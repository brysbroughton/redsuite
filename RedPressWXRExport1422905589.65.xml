                    <p>Twenty years ago today, on the April election day of 1990, the voters of Springfield and thirteen surrounding public school districts approved the creation of Ozarks Technical Community College. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A little more than a year later, in September 1991, with 1,198 college credit students, OTC opened its doors at Cox Medical Center North and at 815 N. Sherman in Lincoln Hall and Graff Hall, facilities which formerly housed the Graff Area Vocational Technical Center.&nbsp; The Springfield campus has grown to include more than a dozen buildings, as well as fine arts facilities in the historic Gillioz Theatre complex in downtown Springfield, and a nearby Center for Workforce Development.&nbsp; The College also serves students through the Richwood Valley campus in Christian County, education centers in Branson, Lebanon and Waynesville, additional nursing program opportunities in Reeds Spring, and online degree options.</p>
<p>Enrollment has grown at an annual compound rate of 13.3% between 1991 and 2009, with nearly 13,000 students attending OTC in the fall of 2009.&nbsp; Since 1991, more than 200,000 citizens of southwest Missouri have taken advantage of one or more of the college&rsquo;s educational services.</p>
<p><em>To commemorate the College&rsquo;s 20th anniversary, an ice cream social will be held Tuesday, April 6, at 3 p.m. in the Information Commons Atrium at the Springfield campus, 1001 E. Chestnut Expressway.&nbsp; All students, faculty, and staff have been invited to celebrate this important milestone.&nbsp; </em></p>
