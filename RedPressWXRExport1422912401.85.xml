<p class="MsoNormal">There is a great sense of pride at Ozarks Technical Community College thanks to a recent story on the NBC Nightly News.</p>
<p>The two-minute story on the Nov. 13 NBC news broadcast focused on how the Springfield, Mo., college developed classes that begin around midnight and how students have responded overwhelmingly in favor of the class times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are grateful to NBC News for its report on our late-night classes,&rdquo; says OTC&rsquo;s Chancellor Dr. Hal L. Higdon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The story shows how community colleges are an important part of this country&rsquo;s educational system. Our development of the late night courses was a direct response to our students&rsquo; needs for flexible class times. This is what community colleges do best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Along with Dr. Higdon, an instructor and several students also were interviewed in the report.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Community colleges are full. We just had to find the time in the day that we had room and that was midnight,&rdquo; Dr. Higdon said in the broadcast.</p>
<p>Andrew Crocker, who teaches political science, said he was thrilled to be in a story about something he highly endorses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the moment they began late-night classes, I thought it was a bright idea and I volunteered immediately. I have two classes. I didn&rsquo;t expect them to get two dozen students,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was happy to be a part of the report. The courses allow the school to expand even more to meet the needs for more students.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christine Ash, who confessed on the broadcast that she thought she was signing up for a class that started in the morning, said she&rsquo;s now a believer in the late-night courses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I love it. There are only seven people in our public speaking class and it&rsquo;s easier to get up in front of them and talk,&rdquo; said Ash, who is studying Machine Tool Technology.</p>
<p>Ash was contacted by relatives from as far away as Iowa after seeing the broadcast, said it was funny when the TV crew came into that class because &ldquo;I was finishing my speech and they thought I was the instructor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julie Paxton, a math instructor, said the report will go a long way to telling the nation about OTC&rsquo;s innovative approach to scheduling classes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it was great. It was nice to get the word out. When I tell people about the classes, they ask why I would do that. But offering those courses reaches out to a special niche of the population who need special times to schedule going to class,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think people are going to be surprised by what we do. It&rsquo;s quite a novelty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve McDaniel, a student in the public speaking class that was filmed, said he was a little nervous when the camera crew started filming him giving his speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was the last one to give a speech. It made it more exciting. I settled down after a while,&rdquo; said McDaniel, who was interviewed for about 10 minutes.</p>
<p>McDaniel is majoring in accounting, and said the late-night courses work out better for him as he and his wife are expecting their first child in a few weeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It lets us set hours for work and for school. I wish there were more classes,&rdquo; said McDaniel, who added that his boss in the receiving department at Bass Pro Shops/Outdoor World in Springfield, Mo., who made a big deal of his TV appearance.</p>
<p>Dr. Higdon has been receiving calls and emails from other institutions around the country about what&rsquo;s involved in offering late-night courses.</p>
<p>His answer has been quite simple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put the classes on the schedule. Students will sign up for them,&rdquo; he said.</p>

                    <P>OTC Middle College and Big Brothers Big Sisters have partnered to create a pilot mentoring program that pairs students with career professionals.</P>
<P>In the program, the mentor meets with the mentee on a monthly basis to help guide the student on a path for success in school and in their future career. </P>
<P>Both the Middle College program and Big Brothers Big Sisters of Springfield are overseeing the program.</P>
<P>"Our mentors are helping students with academics, attendance and future goal setting," said Tiffany Brunner, Middle College director.</P>
<P>The No. 1 reason students drop out of high school is because they think no one cares, and our mentors will help us keep our students on track, and in pursuit of their goals.</P>
<P>Chelsea Forsee, who became an instructor in the Middle College program after working three years with Big Brothers Big Sisters, is&nbsp;heading up&nbsp;the project. She said the program was established with a $10,000 grant from the Darr Family Foundation.</P>
<P>"This program serves the needs of teens who are looking for someone to talk to about their educational issues and needs," she said.</P>
<P>The mentors include educators, bankers and administrators.</P>
<P>Dr. Shelia Wynn, assistant principal at Parkview High School, is mentoring Heather Friend, a junior in the Middle College program.</P>
<P>"I thought if I had a mentor it would help me find the right college to attend," Heather said. "We text each other. It works for me."</P>
<P>Wynn said she was mentored when she grew up and wanted to pay it forward.</P>
<P>"I had a lot of great mentoring. Mentoring should be a part of everyone's life," she said.</P>
<P>While the program is just getting started, Brunner said its impact on students is promising</P>
<P>"Our students can learn steps to take from their mentors that are often invisible unless they have someone guiding them through the process of higher education," she said. </P>
<P>"We are excited to see what are students are going to do in the future, and there is no doubt that mentors will play a tremendous role."</P><I>

                    <p>By Steve Koehler</p>
<p>Three Ozarks Technical Community College students are part of the 18-member inaugural class of the Ozarks Teacher Corps, who will receive scholarships to become teachers with a special destination when they graduate.</p>
<p>As recipients, the students commit to teaching in a rural school district for at least three years after graduation.</p>
<p>The scholarships are being funded by the Community Foundation of the Ozarks through its $1.7 million Chesley and Flora Lee Wallis Scholarship Fund.</p>
<p>The three OTC recipients are Mykie Nash, an elementary education major from Nixa, Nikki Matney, working to be a high-school math instructor from Willard and Rachael Buck, an elementary education major from Monett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Growing up in a small community created the kind of childhood that I cherished; and as a mother of two young children, my hope is that I am able to provide my kids with the same small town neighborhood experience,&rdquo; Nash said.</p>
<p>The Ozarks Teacher Corps is designed to recruit, prepare and retain outstanding teachers for rural communities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The corps will develop a cadre of talented teaching candidates who will explore rural education issues, serve as teacher interns in small schools and commit to teaching in their respective home communities for at least three years,&rdquo; said Julie Leeth, CFO Executive Vice President.</p>
<p>Over time, organizers said they hope the Ozarks Teacher Corps will develop a growing network of educator-activists who recognize the importance of rural education to a sustainable American society.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Sophomore-level students at OTC, Missouri State, Drury, Baptist Bible College and Evangel, are eligible for the scholarship. Part of the application process includes having candidates write an essay on the value of rural schools and be recommended for the corps by their school administrators.</p>
<p>Upon selection, the participants receive a $4,000 per year scholarship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rural schools need to teach students the benefits of living in their community. It is an amazing feeling to shop in a local store and feel like the purchase being made is helping the store stay in business,&rdquo; Matney said.</p>
<p>Information on the 2011 program will be available after Jan. 1, 2011. To read about the program, go to http://www.ruralschoolspartnership.org/grants.</p>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>Tim Mooney, whose interpretation of Moli&egrave;re&rsquo;s play &ldquo;Tartuffe&rdquo; will be performed at Ozarks Technical Community College&rsquo;s spring play, will be in Springfield Feb. 16 to perform his one-man play &ldquo;Moli&egrave;re Than Thou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mooney&rsquo;s performance will be presented at the Gillioz Theater at 7 p.m. Tickets are $5 and go one sale an hour before the production. His appearance is sponsored by OTC Student Life and the Gillioz Theater.</p>
<p>The play &ldquo;Tartuffe&rdquo; will be performed March 13-15 at the Gillioz.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having the author who adapted the play visit your production is an unique and amazing opportunity. As an actor in this particular production I am excited and a little intimidated to be getting advice from someone of Tim Mooney's credentials,&rdquo; said Kenneth Wilson, facility manager of OTC Fine Arts at the Gillioz.</p>
<p>Mooney has been translating Moli&egrave;re&rsquo;s plays for more than 10 years, turning the original 17<sup>th</sup> century French versions into English and in rhyming couplets. Moli&egrave;re wrote many of his plays in that rhyming style.</p>
<p>Mooney said it took him 17 days to translate &ldquo;Tartuffe,&rdquo; which is Moli&egrave;re&rsquo;s commentary on religious hypocrisy.</p>
<p>The comedy is arguably Moli&egrave;re&rsquo;s most famous play. It was written and first performed in 1664 and almost immediately censored by the outcry of the self-labeled "devout" people of France, who were very influential in the court of King Louis XIV.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The message of &lsquo;Tartuffe&rsquo; is you can&rsquo;t judge someone just by what they say regarding religion,&rdquo; Mooney said.</p>
<p>Mooney said Moli&egrave;re&rsquo;s commentary on life in France was similar to the work of Mark Twain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moli&egrave;re was a champion of the little people He was revealing hypocrisy,&rdquo; Mooney said.</p>
<p>Mooney&rsquo;s is interpretation of &ldquo;Tartuffe&rdquo; and other plays have been widely accepted in venues where they are performed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot of French die-hards who are attached to the original French version don&rsquo;t like him in English but for the most part the plays have been accepted very well,&rdquo; Mooney said.</p>
<p>Following his performance, Mooney will conduct workshops for OTC theater students Feb. 17</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">From successful fundraising to new construction projects to record enrollment, 2010 was a very busy year.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">OTC Foundation exceeded its $10 million capital campaign thanks to a $100,000 gift from The Sutherland Foundation of Kansas City. Throughout the year, the Foundation received a large number of generous gifts. Some include:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&bull; Reuben and Mary Lou Casey of San Clemente, Calif., donated two buildings in Lebanon, valued at $2.6 million, making it the largest donation in OTC&rsquo;s history. The buildings will become the new home of the Lebanon Education Center.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&bull; Springfield business icon Carol Jones donated $500,000 for scholarships and the newly named Carol Jones Writing Center.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&bull; The CoxHealth and St. John&rsquo;s Foundation for Community Health PLEDGED a total of $500,000 to create a new scholarship program for dependants of CoxHealth and St. John&rsquo;s employees in OTC&rsquo;s Allied Health programs.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&bull; Glenn Larson, owner of Peterbilt of Springfield, donated $100,000 to endow the Larson Family Scholarship and also gave two trucks valued at $59,000 for the College&rsquo;s Transport Training Institute.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Enrollment continued to rise at a record pace with fall 2010 enrollment up 15.9 percent; spring increased 16.6 percent and summer was up 11.7 percent.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The fall semester started with the opening of a new parking lot on the site of the old Tindle Mill, giving students hundreds of new parking spaces.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After voters in the Hollister School district approved joining the OTC district, land was purchased for the future site of an education center there.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The board also approved funding for the renovation of the new Lebanon buildings and for the addition of 10 classrooms, offices and a student study area to the second floor of the Information Commons West building on the main campus.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;In spite of cuts to state funding and looming larger cuts from the state, OTC has served more students and served our communities in many different ways. We are grateful to all who contributed to our many successes in 2010. We look forward to having a good year in 2011,&rdquo; said OTC President Hal L. Higdon.</p>

                    <p>The 3rd Annual OTC Foundation Golf Tournament, held recently at the Hickory Hills Country Club, brought 88 area players together for a common goal:&nbsp; supporting the students of Ozarks Technical Community College.&nbsp; The 22 teams of four, along with event sponsors, raised a total of $17,543 dollars, which will be used for student scholarships.<br /><br />&ldquo;More than 60 percent of our students qualify for some form of financial aid, and providing scholarships through the OTC Foundation is more vital than ever,&rdquo; explained Cliff Davis, executive director of the OTC Foundation and vice president for Institutional Advancement.&nbsp; &ldquo;Financial aid is often the deciding factor in whether or not a student can attend college at all.&nbsp; The money raised by this tournament will help so many of those students to continue their education, enhance their job skills, and improve their lives.&rdquo;<br /><br />The money raised from this year&rsquo;s tournament will help the OTC Foundation to meet its $2.5 million Student Scholarship initiative, a part of its ongoing Imagine. Invest. Inspire. Major Gifts Capital Campaign.&nbsp; Other initiatives in the Campaign include: Center for Workforce Development, $3 million; Center for Health Education, $2 million; and Student Support Programs, $2 million.<br /><br />The OTC Foundation works to coordinate regional resources into a broad-based financial support network for the College and its students.&nbsp; Established in 1995, the Foundation continues to grow, raising money toward student scholarships, program development, and other improvements for the College.</p>

		<title>Additional courses in Lebanon aimed at workforce</title>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>Additional noncredit courses and workshops, some aimed to help those looking to rejoin the workforce, will be offered this fall at Ozarks Technical Community College&rsquo;s Lebanon education center.</p>
<p>The expansion of courses and workshops comes at the request of residents in the outlying areas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because of the job displacement situation, the Missouri Career Centers have asked us for several programs in various areas,&rdquo; said Dana Thorp Patterson, Director of OTC&rsquo;s Continuing Education Center.</p>
<p>In response to the requests, a basic &ldquo;new user&rdquo; series of computer classes is being offered, which provides a complete certificate program for individuals who need to learn everything from basics of keyboarding to using various applications and tools including email, using the Internet and even managing e-files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;The program is scheduled so that someone with limited time and limited knowledge can take the series and earn a certificate. We are even offering free books to everyone signing up for the series. If an individual is not interested in the certificate, the person can still take any class individually as needed,&rdquo; Patterson said.</p>
<p>Healthcare courses will also be offered for those looking to enter the workforce quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are offering, for the first time, our Certified Nurse Assistant training program in the Lebanon area. The program is a model from our state-approved existing program here in Springfield. Healthcare jobs are readily available and we&rsquo;ve learned from the various healthcare centers in our region that CNAs are needed,&rdquo; Patterson said.</p>
<p>The certification course is open to individuals who are already on board at facilities in Lebanon but the offerings are expected to be expanded in the future to include a comprehensive program for individuals seeing jobs and wishing to gain their credential to improve their chances of being hired.</p>
<p>Patterson said Beginning Spanish continues to be requested in all communities and by offering a five-week program, individuals have an opportunity to try the course and continue on as additional workshops are offered to build on their skills.</p>
<p>For more information about any of these classes, or to sign up, call the Lebanon Center at (417) 532-5044&nbsp; &ndash; or the Continuing Ed Center in Springfield at (417) 447-8888. A complete listing of courses (with dates/times/fees) can be viewed on the OTC website at www.otc.edu/continuinged &lt;http://www.otc.edu/continuinged&gt; .</p>

		<title>Agriculture degree added starting in fall</title>

                    <p>Ozarks Technical Community College is offering a agriculture degree  beginning this fall.</p>
<p>The college's turf  and landscape management program and current agriculture courses are  merging for several reasons.</p>
<p>"We felt it would give agriculture students who were  planning to transfer to a four-year school more options for transfer.  Also, more students interested in the turf and landscape program may  consider having the option of transferring and getting a higher degree  after completing their OTC program," said Layton Childress, dean of  technical education at OTC.</p>
<p>"Since many outlying school districts offer  agriculture programs, it seemed like a natural fit for students to  continue after high school to get an agriculture degree with several  options for areas of emphasis."</p>
<p>Danelle Maxwell, turf and landscape management  instructor and chair of the Industrial &amp; Manufacturing Department,  said the new program would target A+ students in agriculture school  districts.</p>
<p>The A+  program is a state program that pays a qualifying student's tuition to a  community college.</p>
<p>"There  is a need by those students from those schools for this program," she  said.</p>
<p>The program  emphasis will shift to agriculture courses while turf and landscape  courses will become elective courses.</p>
<p>Maxwell said there is a greater interest in the  agriculture program since OTC and College of the Ozarks in Hollister  signed an articulation agreement last fall to make for an efficient  transition from the completion of an OTC Associate of Arts degree to a  Bachelor of Arts at C of O for transfer students pursuing agriculture  students.</p>
<p>The  agreement designates certain credits earned at OTC to apply to specific  agriculture course requirements. Missouri State University also accepts  OTC agriculture courses toward its agriculture degree, Maxwell said.</p>
<p>"Agriculture remains a  big business in the region and there is a real need to meet that demand  here. There is a real need for a college education in agriculture,"  Maxwell said.</p>

		<title>Agriculture students study donated propane mower</title>

                    <P>The OTC agriculture department isnt cooking with gas. Instead, they are cutting with it.</P>
<P>The program recently accepted a new propane-powered, zero-degree turn commercial mower that will allow students to study the properties of propane-powered mowers along with learning about efforts to make such landscaping work more environmentally friendly.</P>
<P>The mower, valued at more than $11,000, was donated from the Missouri Propane Education and Research Council. According to program director Rob Flatness, the college will be in line to receive a new mower every two years.</P>
<P>The college also is receiving two standalone engines along with conversion kits to learn how to connect propane to them.</P>
<P>"The engines and mower give students the opportunity to work with alternative fuels. There's nothing to be afraid of when working with them. It will dispel a lot of myths," Flatness said.</P>
<P>The program uses the machine to cut a section of grass on the college's Springfield campus from National Avenue west to Hampton Avenue.</P>
<P>Flatness said there are myths that propane won't deliver power equal to a gasoline- or diesel-driven mower.</P>
<P>"The propane mower is a good alternative to what is used now," Flatness said. "It performs on a par with gasoline. It cost $1.50 a gallon for propane and gas is in the $3 neighborhood. Eventually, more will be turning to propane."</P>
<P>In addition to lower costs, a propane-powered mower produces less harmful carbon emissions, offers easy on-site refueling options and is fueled by a source that is abundant in the U.S.</P>
<P>"This is a cutting-edge machine," Flatness said. "It can run longer between oil changes and the oil doesn't look worn out when it's changed. It's golden and clean."</P>
<P>Students who took the first rides on the machine were impressed.</P>
<P>"It's comfortable. It's nice," said Steve Harris of Fair Play. "It's comparable power-wise to a gasoline machine."</P>
<P>Clayton Smith-Miller of Springfield said the mower drove as well as a gasoline-powered machine.</P>
<P>"It handled great. It was more sensitive," he said.</P><I>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>Allied health positions continue to rank at the top of the best-paying jobs of Ozarks Technical Community College graduates while business is at the top of technical majors students are enrolling in this fall.</p>
<p>Statistics released by OTC&rsquo;s Career Employment Services show dental hygiene positions taken by those who graduated last fall or this spring paid an average of $58,996 with physical therapy assistants second, earning $45,270.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shows how we meet some of the needs of the business community. I think we meet the demands,&rdquo; said Kathy Christy, director of OTC&rsquo;s career services office.</p>
<p>Dianna Parker, OTC&rsquo;s director of research and planning who compiled the information on top declared majors compiled from 2,443 OTC students, said the business and accounting majors were at the top of the list because &ldquo;business is the backbone of a lot of different degrees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Parker said that the growth in majors such as the culinary arts and health information technology is due to the popularity of the programs and the overall growth in enrollment at OTC.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Culinary arts has more than doubled in five years. That&rsquo;s because they have a really good program. Health information technology has almost doubled in four years,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;According to the Missouri Economic Research and Information Center, the 20 job openings in the state for 2008 and 2009 include, registered nurses, truck drivers, child care workers, bookkeepers, accountants and home care aides.</p>
<p>All of those positions can be studied through OTC&rsquo;s technical education and allied health programs.</p>
<p>But graduating students into top paying jobs and attracting other students into the top technical majors doesn&rsquo;t mean the work is over for Christy and others at OTC.</p>
<p>The director and her staff are in constant touch with businesses and their leaders about job demands of the future,</p>
<p>Christy said several OTC administrators recently met with St. John&rsquo;s Hospital administrators who discussed their projected staffing needs and the top jobs they will expect to fill over the next 10 years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Christy understands the hospital is going paperless and converting all paper records to an electronic format, which means a degree in health information technology might increase in demand in years to come.</p>
<p>Christy is hoping to get other businesses to look into the future, too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been calling other companies to see if they&rsquo;re doing a similar workforce assessment to determine where their needs may be,&rdquo; Christy said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Once OTC has that information we can discuss the type of courses that need to be designed and offered to better educate our students in the skills that will be needed and the types of jobs that will be available.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Help in determining what courses and degrees to offer come from OTC&rsquo;s many advisory boards. Each technical education and allied health program has an advisory board made up of experienced community leaders who provide valuable input into course content.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We get a pulse of what&rsquo;s happening out there and can get a snapshot in time of what&rsquo;s going on in the real world,&rdquo; she said.</p>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>If you&rsquo;ve ever wondered what you can do to become more &ldquo;green&rdquo; when it comes to alternative energy sources, Ozarks Technical Community College&rsquo;s Center for Workforce Development has a course for you.</p>
<p>The Center will offer a class June 30 through July 14 examining the various types and applications of alternative energy sources including solar, wind, thermal and methane.&nbsp; The course will look at basic home-energy needs and how green practices can be used both in the home and in a small-business setting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hope to spark interest in the community not only in homes but in businesses that want to learn the advantages of implementing green practices,&rdquo; said Dawn Busick, the center&rsquo;s executive director.</p>
<p>Topics to be discussed include: alternative energy systems, hybrid systems, alternative heating and cooling systems along with insulation and windows techniques. A session on hybrid systems will discuss real solutions and current options in the market and how to integrate these systems.</p>
<p>Busick said putting some of the green alternatives to be discussed in the course into practice, consumers and businesses could realize an energy-cost savings as well as help improve the environment.</p>
<p>It also could lead some people to a career in alternative energy, she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The class is intended to expose people to alternatives to see if it&rsquo;s something they might be interested in. It can be a career opportunity. It is a sustainable occupation that will be around for awhile,&rdquo; Busick said.</p>
<p>The workforce development class will be held over four nights at the center, 614 N. Washington Ave. Those who sign up can attend any or all of the four sessions. Classes will be held from 5:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. The cost is $199.</p>
<p>To register, call 447-8888 or email continuinged@otc.edu.</p>

                    <!-- p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal { margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: "Times New Roman"; }a:link, span.MsoHyperlink { color: blue; text-decoration: underline; }a:visited, span.MsoHyperlinkFollowed { color: purple; text-decoration: underline; }div.Section1 { page: Section1; } -->
<p class="MsoNormal">Thanks to a grant from the state&rsquo;s Training for Tomorrow initiative, Ozarks Technical Community College will be taking applications next month for a new hybrid dental assisting program.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The grant is being to write the Dental Assisting/Hybrid Track program and pay for the first year of offering it in the spring of 2012. Applications will be until Oct. 15, 2011.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Training for Tomorrow initiative was launched by Gov. Jay Nixon to help Missouri community colleges create or expand training programs to serve additional students with training in high-tech fields.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The dental assisting program will be able to reach more students, said Janet Sell, program coordinator for dental assisting.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;We were looking for a non-traditional way of offering the program for those who work or have children. So, we began looking for alternatives,&rdquo; Sell said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The hybrid program, written by dental instructor Ida Guynn, will allow students to take classes online during the week and come to laboratory sessions on campus at night or on weekends. Guynn will be the instructor for the program.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;We were asking ourselves why can&rsquo;t we do it online with labs at night or weekends when babysitting can be more easily obtained. It&rsquo;s for young parents who have to work. They have to be self-motivators, too, since the classes are online,&rdquo; Sell said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The program will allow students to obtain a certificate in one year and offer the option of a second year in order to earn an Associate of Arts in Science degree. Clinicals will require students to do some 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. work.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">While some dental assisting classes are already online, this will be the first program to offer a combination of online instruction and seated lab sessions in the same class. The online portion of the courses will also include videos of lab procedures and lectures instead of slide presentations.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&ldquo;It will fit the students&rsquo; schedule better and make it more efficient for them,&rdquo; Sell said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;For more about the program, go to <a href="http://www.otc.edu/alliedhealth/13458.php">http://www.otc.edu/alliedhealth/13458.php</a></p>

		<title>Art students study woodcuts made 80 years ago</title>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many classes at OTC take pride in using state-of-the-art technology to teach students.</p>
<p>In one case, however, the generosity of one OTC staff member finds the Art 130 printmaking class taking a step back in time, using a printing technique that most students had never seen before last week.</p>
<p>Rebekah McCormack, who works in the College&rsquo;s Student Services, recently inherited three woodcuts used for printing back in the 1930s. The three depict a boat on the ocean, a train and a stagecoach.</p>
<p>The large cuttings, which looked like oversized rubber stamps, were made from cherry wood by McCormack&rsquo;s great uncle Carson Donnell from Illinois. He died in 1969. She lent them to Cathy Clemens to use in her printmaking class to show students how the process used to be done with woodcuts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it would be a useful tool for the students who had never printed off of wood blocks.&nbsp; I thought it would give them the opportunity to test out their printing skills. I had never seen or gotten a print from the wood blocks either,&rdquo; McCormack said.</p>
<p>Clemens said students normally make cuttings from linoleum. Woodcuts like those from McCormack are very detailed and can take hours to make.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The traditional method of printing was making wood cuts. With these, we were able to show the process. The students are seeing something that is 80-plus years old,&rdquo; Clemens said.</p>
<p>Both McCormack and the students who used the cuts were happy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we made the print, we could see the satisfaction on Becky&rsquo;s face. She had never seen the prints before. The artist&rsquo;s desire is to bring satisfaction to the patron&rsquo;s face,&rdquo; Clemens said.</p>
<p>Jorge Valencia, a Springfield student, was excited to take his turn at making a print of the sailing ship for himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like the boat a lot and the way the artist did all that detail. I&rsquo;m making something that was made by a man who is no longer here. I&rsquo;m going to frame this and keep it. It&rsquo;s pretty cool. I feel special,&rdquo; Valencia said.</p>

		<title>Arthur, Merlin at the heart of OTC Spring Play</title>

                    <p>Ozarks Technical Community College&rsquo;s Theater Department will turn the clock back 1,500 years with its spring play production of&nbsp; &ldquo;Arthur&rsquo;s Stone, Merlin&rsquo;s Fire: The Making of a King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The play opens tonight at 7:30 at the Gillioz Theater with other performances at 7:30 p.m. Saturday and 2:30 p.m. Sunday. Tickets are $10 and available at the Gillioz box office.</p>
<p>The play, set in 500 A.D., has more of everything compared to past OTC productions, from the largest cast to more stage area that will extend out from the existing stage towards the audience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also been more of a challenge for Jon Herbert, the play&rsquo;s director and OTC theater instructor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has 23 cast members, all from OTC or family members of OTC folks. We have a great cast and it&rsquo;s a fun challenge to meet all of the demands this play presents us,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The play is an exciting and inspiring drama about what happens when young Arthur, who has never fought in a battle, pulls a mystical sword from a stone and is declared emperor of Britain. The play examines the struggles Arthur faces as he confronts good and evil forces that try to influence him.</p>
<p>The play is set in the rustic and gritty dark ages and is filled with magic, mysticism and enchanted forests. The play is appropriate for all ages.</p>
<p>Key components of the play are the action scenes, complete with spectacular sword fights and hand-to-hand combat. The cast has been working on refining the choreography for months. The cast will wear authentic period costumes.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &ldquo;I love the story of King Arthur. It resonated with me. This play doesn&rsquo;t deal with the whole story. It has to do with just the first part of legend and Arthur&rsquo;s decision to accept his destiny,&rdquo; Herbert said.</p>
<p>Herbert said there is a lot of the Harry Potter character in Arthur and it should resonate with modern audiences, including those who are younger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s classic mythology. The playwright, Kathryn Petersen, delivers a fresh look at the &lsquo;sword in the stone&rsquo; myth,&rdquo; Herbert said.</p>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>Close your eyes and think back to those days when gas was under a buck and you cruised the streets in your gleaming &rsquo;67 GTO or a flashy&rsquo;68 Mustang convertible.</p>
<p>Those were the days and Saturday, car lovers can relive those days with the annual Auto and Motorcycle Show at OTC.</p>
<p>The event will start at 9 a.m. in the parking lot south of the Industry Transportation and Technology Center on the OTC campus. The awards presentation will begin at 2 p.m.</p>
<p>Admission is free and there is a fee for those who want to enter a car or motorcycle. There will also be food, live music and door prizes.</p>
<p>The money goes to the OTC students who are in the college&rsquo;s chapter of Skills USA.</p>
<p>Skills USA is a student organization that allows students to use what they learn in the shops and classrooms in competition with other students.</p>
<p>Competitions are held locally as well as on a state, national and international level in a variety of categories including auto collision and heating and air conditioning.</p>
<p>The car show has been going on for about 20 years and attracts about 100 entries a year, said Terry Pridgeon, an instructor in the auto collision repair department at OTC, who coordinates the event.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mainly, we get a lot of restored muscle cars and hot rods, Mustangs and Corvettes,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Awards will be given in a number of categories including Best of Show, Best Engine, Best Interior along with a President&rsquo;s, Vice President&rsquo;s and Dean&rsquo;s choice.</p>
<p>There will be classes for students and alumni. Pridgeon said a number of students enter cars. Students also serve as judges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We train them to look at this stuff. They should know what they&rsquo;re looking at,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>And while you&rsquo;re checking out the cool cars, you can check out the college, too.</p>
<p>OTC will be conducting an open house Saturday from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. in the Information Commons Atrium. The event is designed for members of the community to learn more about opportunities provided by the college.</p>
<p>Information will also be provided on some of the many resources offered, including financial aid options, the Speckman Tutoring and Learning Center, disability support services, and career employment services.</p>
<p>In addition, tours of the college&rsquo;s technical and general education facilities will be available, and will be led by faculty and staff.</p>

		<title>Banned books topic of class at OTC Richwood Valley</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
                    
                    <P>Today may mark the start of Banned Book Week, but OTC instructor Lyndsey Strahan and her class at OTC Richwood Valley have been studying the issue of banned books all semester.</P>
<P>Banned Books Week&nbsp;is an annual&nbsp;<A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness%22%20%5Co%20%22Awareness">awareness</A>&nbsp;campaign that celebrates the freedom to read draws attention to&nbsp;<A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_books_banned_by_governments">banned</A>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge_(literature)%22%20%5Co%20%22Challenge%20(literature)">challenged</A>&nbsp;books and highlights persecuted individuals.<A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banned_Books_Week%22%20%5Cl%20%22cite_note-AI-3"> <SUP></SUP></A></P><SUP>
<P></SUP>This is the first semester the class has been offered at OTC and Strahan said the idea came from students.</P>
<P>"We were talking about specialized classes and they thought about a class on banned books. There have been discussions about how people control other people and their access to ideas," she said. "So far, it's been great. The students are taking a real interest in it."</P>
<P>Strahan said the class not only looks at the banning of books but why literature is important to the culture.</P>
<P>"There is a great access of ideas in literature," she said. "There is value to having access to all types of ideas and stories."</P>
<P>In the class, students will read five assigned books and at the end of the semester, they will choose a banned book to evaluate why it was banned.</P>
<P>The class is studying "Reading Lolita in Tehran," a book by Azar Nafisi and is a memoir about an Iranian woman who started a book club in Tehran, where the members would read Western classics. Nafisi's book is banned in Iran.</P>
<P>Over the years, many American classics have been banned including "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn," "Catcher in the Rye," "Beloved," "Slaughterhouse Five," and "Uncle Tom's Cabin." Recently, "The Hunger Games," "The Bluest Eye" and "Speak" have been added to the list.</P>
<P>"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" has been banned very often in the U.S. and there are many reasons for it and other classics being taken off the shelves, according to Strahan.</P>
<P>"Sometimes it depends on the age of the student reading the book. It can be about language, sexual situations or racial issues," she said. "There's a difference of opinion over at what age should it be discussed."</P>
<P></P>

                    <P>As the new president of Missouri Community College Association's board of directors, Joan Barrett wants to continue to help advocate for the state's two-year colleges any way she can.</P>
<P>"I have served the organization for the past two years and have thoroughly enjoyed getting to know my community college colleagues across the state and have a better understanding of the unique mission of each of our state's community colleges&nbsp;and the communities they serve," said OTC's associate vice chancellor for student affairs.</P>
<P>"In a time when much is asked of community colleges, it is an honor to serve the association's members by helping develop professional development offerings throughout the year."</P>
<P>MCCA is an individual membership organization dedicated to providing professional development and networking opportunities, education, and advocacy for current and former community college faculty, staff, administrators, trustees, and students.</P>
<P>The board works to support the association members' professional development, provides members with opportunities for networking, and supports these efforts.</P>
<P>Barrett said the MCCA board is in the enviable position of advocating for particular issues common to community colleges. </P>
<P>"Having a voice in leading those discussions is an honor and of particular interest to me," said Barrett. </P>
<P>Topics of interest to the board and others in the state's community college system include the viability of the A+ program, increasing enrollment and improving completion rates. </P>
<P>The role of community colleges in helping pull the country out of an economic morass has been a key topic of discussion in the presidential campaign. </P>
<P>Barrett is happy to see the community colleges' contributions put in such a positive light by everyone.</P>
<P>"It's not even a political issue. Everyone recognizes the role of the community college. Our responsiveness has been recognized time and again. We are the institutions that can be used to further along the agenda of putting trained graduates in the workplace," she said.</P>
<P>And Barrett believes that furthering one's education can only have a positive impact.</P>
<P>"There has to be something after high school in terms of education and at community college, we can do some really cool stuff for folks," she said.</P>

<p class="MsoNormal">Becky Crocker&rsquo;s work in Haiti has earned her a trip to Vienna, Austria.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Crocker, director of the Ozarks Technical Community College&rsquo;s Physical Therapist Assistant program, will co-present a poster to the Third European Congress on Physiotherapy Education next month.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Crocker has made two trips to the Caribbean country that was devastated by an earthquake in 2010. In Haiti, Crocker worked with a number of health professionals to provide medical assistance to the country&rsquo;s victims.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Crocker will present a poster, entitled &ldquo;<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Interprofessional Collaborative Practice During Disaster Relief Work in Haiti: An Ethnographic Study,&rdquo; that focuses</span> on how things were organized in the shaken country.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;It talks about how you take different health professionals from all over the world and put them together working in a small hospital as a high-performance health team,&rdquo; Crocker said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Crocker collaborated on the poster and presentation with Susan Klappa, associate professor, School of Physical Therapy at the University of Incarnate Word in San Antonio, Tex.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;An interprofessional collaborative practice in Haiti developed quickly as health care volunteers learned about from and with each other as they focused on contributing their talents to the greater task at hand. It shows how that happens when they check their egos at the door,&rdquo; said Crocker, who has been working on the five-minute presentation for the past 2 years.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;I knew I couldn&rsquo;t pass this opportunity up. I told myself, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got to go.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">During her trips to Haiti, Crocker saw destruction and conditions that stunned the senses.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:.25in;line-height:13.5pt;background:
white;vertical-align:baseline" class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
color:#444444">&ldquo;There are rats as big as cats. Kids are walking around with rat bites. There are people with wounds from guns because of the violence. There is a lot of spousal abuse. There&rsquo;s going to be a lot of typhoid with the waste water running everywhere,&rdquo; Crocker said.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:.25in;line-height:13.5pt;background:
white;vertical-align:baseline" class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
color:#444444">There is little permanent housing, Crocker said. Instead, a half-million 8-by-10 tents sit side by side for residents to use. Despite the devastation, the spirit of the Haitian people amazes Crocker.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:.25in;line-height:13.5pt;background:
white;vertical-align:baseline" class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
color:#444444">&ldquo;How they love, laugh and smile. How does that happen? I thought I had a good handle on life. They have something more. They can get through situations we can&rsquo;t imagine. I don&rsquo;t understand how they do it,&rdquo; she said.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Students taking Stephen White&rsquo;s Advanced Biology II class at Ozarks Technical Community College are finding it&rsquo;s more than just a seated class.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>White has used the resources of the Ozarks and the professionals who manage it to help his students get the chance to examine wildlife management practices.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>It&rsquo;s something they normally wouldn&rsquo;t get as second-year students.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&ldquo;We partner with the Springfield Nature Center to study wildlife management practices, and problems of running a nature center. &nbsp;We use the opportunity to see what its like to be a professional biologist working in the field,&rdquo; White said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>During a recent trip to the Springfield Nature Center, students listened to professional naturalists talk about habitat care&nbsp;and maintenance and then toured the facility to see example of such work being done at the center.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Seth Talley, a second year student from Nevada and majoring in chemistry, said the information he was getting about the growth of the state&rsquo;s deer population was interesting.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&ldquo;It was also nice to get out of the classroom,&rdquo; he said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Max Goforth, a microbiologist major from Waynesville, said he liked the hands-on approach of the class.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&ldquo;There are so many threads that make up the ecosystem. I didn&rsquo;t know that a fallen tree could help promote good wildlife habitat,&rdquo; he said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The class also met with fish experts at Bass Pro&rsquo;s fish quarantine facility in north Springfield. Students talked with experts in the way the company works to prevent bacteria and parasites from harming the fish that are put on exhibit at the 56 company aquariums.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&ldquo;We are looking for parasites that can harm the fish and an aquarium. We determine the treatment to get rid of them,&rdquo; said Blayk Michaels, operations supervisor for the company&rsquo;s live exhibits.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>J.R. Hill, a student from Ozark, was pleased with the chance to see and meet experts in the wildlife biology field.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&ldquo;I was surprised to have this opportunity and have the hands-on approach. We see to see it up close,&rdquo; he said.</span></p>

                    <P>Nick Kennedy can't remember the last time he went to the zoo. He thinks he might have been 7 or 8 years old.</P>
<P>But Kennedy isn't likely to forget his most recent trip to the Dickerson Park Zoo, which he took last week with other students in his OTC biology class for a behind-the-scenes look at the zoo's operations.</P>
<P>"Ive never gotten a chance to go behind the scenes. I learned a lot about the life cycles and the diversity at the zoo," said the Springfield resident, who is considering a career in conservationism.</P>
<P>About two dozen OTC biology majors were given the extensive tour by zoo staff, which included a look in the elephant barn, the commissary, the hospital, the reptile and amphibian facility and the giraffe station.</P>
<P>"These students know they like biology but not all of them are sure what sub-discipline appeals to them the most," said Stephen White, OTC biology instructor.</P>
<P>Students saw the area where the zoo's herd of elephants is kept, which includes three cows and two bulls. The zoo is one of the leading facilities in the country when it comes to elephant research.</P>
<P>At the commissary, the students saw the types of meals prepared for the animals.</P>
<P>"I learned a lot about the various animals and how varied their diets can be," Kennedy said.</P>
<P>Ariel Braswell of Branson, who plans a career in marine biology, said it was interesting seeing what it takes to feed the animals.</P>
<P>"It's interesting that they feed the wolves alfalfa pellets. I thought they'd be served meat," she said.</P>
<P>Craig Hunter, reptilian and amphibian keeper, showed students the procedures in place when handling venomous snakes. That included the handler required to wear a badge identifying the snake being handled in case the handler is bitten and loses consciousness. The badge tells emergency personnel what snake was being handled and what anti-venom to use.</P>
<P>Hunter said he has never been bitten and it's been at least 40 years since there's been an incident.</P>
<P>White said students keep a journal of what they experienced at the zoo.</P>
<P>"The main thing is that the experience shows them the dedication required to enter the animal husbandry field, and exposes them to some of the realities of running a zoo," White said.</P>

		<title>Bootcamp offers help to those in English courses </title>

                    <P>Jennifer Dunkel insists on preparing students for their next English class instead of just passing them along without the necessary skills to take the class.</P>
<P>As a result, the OTC instructor has developed an English boot camp that helps incoming students prepare for testing to see what level of English instruction suits them best.</P>
<P>For four days, Dunkel puts students through some quick and intense "mental jumping jacks," reviewing everything from punctuation and spelling to grammar and writing, in an effort to prepare them for the COMPASS placement test that determines their English skill level.</P>
<P></P>
<P>"It's for new students out of high school or those who have been out of the classroom for a decade. We cover 30-40 topics in four days and on the fifth day, they take the COMPASS test to determine their English skill level," she said.</P>
<P>"The class is supposed to be a review and if it feels like a review, you're in the right place. If it feels brand new, maybe you need a developmental class."</P>
<P>Kristina Elrick, who took Dunkel's class, said the course was helpful because she didnt like English. She tested out to the English 040 class but after the boot camp course, she was qualified for English 101. She took English 050 first and then English 101. She got As in both the classes.</P>
<P>"I needed the refresher of basic English since I hate English," said Elrick, who is taking classes at OTC in the fall and plans to become an elementary teacher.</P>
<P>She said the testing skills she learned in Dunkel's class has helped her take tests in other classes.</P>
<P>Dunkel, who will be teaching a new session starting today, said of the 35 who have taken the course, 20 have earned a C or better in the English course they've taken after her class. </P>
<P>She said students who came in disliking English finished the class appreciating the opportunity to see what their skill level actually was.</P>
<P>"A student told me the class knocked the rust off their brain. One day, I hope this is the kind of class that is offered year-round. I am not teaching for the COMPASS test. I teach for them to be successful in the next class," she said.</P>
<P>"Students come out of the class with confidence that that's why their score is higher."</P>

                    <p>Colt and Walker Boldman are close brothers, but they are proud to say they are completely different from each other.</p>
<p>Colt is a volunteer fireman; Walker plays violin. Colt likes to listen to Christian rock; Walker prefers classical music with a little Sinatra thrown in. Colt is right-handed. Walker, you guessed it, is left-handed.</p>
<p>But there is one very important commonality in their lives. Both young men attend the exact same classes at the OTC Branson Center, located in The Shoppes at Branson Meadows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walker is the creative one; he writes. I am the logical, methodical one,&rdquo; said Colt, 18.</p>
<p>The brothers from Berryville are the two oldest of 12 brothers and sisters, a group that will soon grow to 13.</p>
<p>Not only do Colt and Walker spend a lot of time at home with their younger siblings, the two drive about 35 minutes one-way every Monday and Wednesday to take five classes at the Branson center.</p>
<p>The brothers are eyeing different careers. Walker wants to become an engineer, possibly attending Missouri University of Science and Technology. Colt wants to continue his education in fire science and may transfer to a four-year institution.</p>
<p>The two share a good-natured attitude toward each other. They spend a lot of time together, whether at home, in the truck heading to and from the OTC Branson Center or spending a few hours between their day and night classes at a fast-food restaurant in Branson studying.</p>
<p>What the brothers share most is a love for their family. They realize they are the ones setting an example for their siblings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are forging the way for the others in the family to follow, to show that they need to go to college and right now, OTC is the best place for us to go to do that,&rdquo; Walker said.</p>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;For eight straight semesters, enrollment at Ozarks Technical Community College&rsquo;s Branson Education Center has grown by double digits.</p>
<p>This fall&rsquo;s enrollment is up by nearly 14 percent with a total of 406 students attending classes at the center, located at The Shoppes at Branson Meadows located at 4440 Gretna Road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think this semester&rsquo;s increase is, in part, a reflection of a larger trend in our area. Some of our growth is due to the fact that the residents of Branson and its surrounding communities increasingly see OTC as an option they should consider,&rdquo; said Rob Griffith, coordinator of the Branson Center.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> &ldquo;The other reason for our growth is that we are seeing a tremendous influx in displaced workers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Displaced workers and non-traditional students are enrolling at the Branson center with a desire to find a career that is year-round, sustainable and has some potential for promotion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The influx of students is putting stress on the center&rsquo;s 11,000-square-foot facility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As we continue to grow, we&rsquo;ll probably reach capacity for our current facility by 2011. &nbsp;It is my hope that the April vote in Hollister will succeed, and the college will be able to invest in a full-service campus sometime in the near future,&rdquo; Griffith said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having our own facility would allow us to begin to offer more of the technical and Allied Health programs that students in this area need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Overall, enrollment at OTC&rsquo;s two campuses and three education centers is up nearly 16 percent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;As we have continued to grow as an institution, our student population has also grown, and we are working hard to meet the needs of each student,&rdquo; said Dr. Hal Higdon, president of the College.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;However, with state funding continuing to diminish, there is little we can do to alleviate our physical capacity issues, particularly at the Springfield campus.&rdquo;</p>

                    <P align=left>While the halls at OTC are filled with college students, there are a number of students who come to the college still enrolled in high school.</P>
<P align=left></P>
<P align=left>Thanks to the OTC Career Center, they can get a jump on their college education.</P>
<P align=left></P>
<P align=left>More than 500 students learn and develop skills in one of 19 technical education programs the center offers. The credits they earn through the Career Center apply toward their college degree work.</P>
<P align=left></P>
<P align=left>"Many of our students see a benefit in attending through the OTC Career Center, and I have heard students say their high school GPA has also improved since they started at OTC," said Jackie Jenkins, director of the Career Center.</P>
<P align=left></P>
<P></P>
<P align=left>Many students credit the Center for improving their interest in heading to college after high school graduation.</P>
<P align=left></P>
<P align=left>"I heard of the Center from my counselor," said Sean McClay, a senior from Bolivar High School who is studying diesel technology. "It's really a beneficial program. I've always been intrigued with mechanics."</P>
<P align=left></P>
<P align=left>McClay has been attending classes at OTC for two years and has 32 college credits. </P>
<P align=left></P>
<P align=left>"The classes are very hands on and include the physical aspects of the work and what's it like in the real world," said McClay, who plans to get a mechanical engineering degree from Missouri University of Science and Technology in Rolla.</P>
<P align=left></P>
<P align=left>Candace Colley, a senior from Willard, is studying health science through the Career Center. She said she is taking the college courses "to get ahead of the game" on her way to becoming a surgical technician. She has 16 college credits.</P>
<P align=left></P>
<P align=left>"I've enjoyed the clinical work. You see a little bit of everything," she said.</P>
<P align=left></P>
<P align=left>Taking classes at OTC makes Cooley feel like a college student, she said.</P>
<P align=left></P>
<P align=left>"You're treated with respect. There's not as much tension here. The teachers are awesome," she said.</P>
<P align=left></P>
<P align=left>Cody Newell of Clever is a junior and has just started studying construction technology at OTC. He wants to earn his bachelor's degree in construction management.</P>
<P align=left></P>
<P align=left>"If I wasn't going to OTC, I don't think I'd be working as hard in high school. I plan on coming back next year. Im telling all my friends about it," he said.</P>

		<title>Career Center student first to enter Honors Program</title>

                    <p>Taylor Stav is a soft-spoken OTC student who hopes her actions will speak loudly.</p>
<p>The Willard High School graduate is the first student to advance from OTC&rsquo;s high school Career Center program to be accepted into the OTC Honors Program.</p>
<p>But being accepted into the college isn&rsquo;t enough for this 18 year old. She hopes to excel in the program and at OTC.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want my name to stand out at OTC. I want to graduate from here and show other schools that I&rsquo;ll be a top student thanks to OTC,&rdquo; Taylor said.</p>
<p>Taylor, who has a 3.6 grade point average, applied to the program, which gives selected students a chance to take advanced-level classes, after talking to Danelle Maxwell, an instructor in the agriculture program.</p>
<p>Taylor was looking for something like the Honors Program since she admits she didn&rsquo;t take high school seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a perfectionist. I didn&rsquo;t challenge myself in high school. I could have done better,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;I like the honors classes and how we have a lot of discussions. They are a lot more thought out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, Taylor was excited when she was one of 16 accepted this semester into the program, which its director, Todd Yerby, says is designed to give students &ldquo;a more stimulating environment for learning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The courses are challenging and in a different format with lectures. Students also are active in social events, fundraising and community involvement,&rdquo; Yerby said.</p>
<p>Taylor has no plans to take it easy at OTC. Her future is in botany and the genetics of plant life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to learn about plants,&rdquo; she said. At home, she has a small garden and her uncles grow soybeans.</p>
<p>Taylor plans to use what she learns about plants towards her ultimate goals as a botanist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to find a cure to some disease through the use of plants,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to win the Nobel Prize.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>By Steve Koehler</p>
<p>The Center for Workforce Development at Ozarks Technical Community College will offer area businesses and companies a program entitled &ldquo;Basics for Your Bottom Line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The program was developed after discussions with local business&nbsp;leaders. The one-day seminar will focus on strengthening workforce skills that will result in a positive impact on a company&rsquo;s bottom line.</p>
<p>Key topics of the seminar include:</p>
<p>&bull; Identifying and adapting to the business culture</p>
<p>&bull; Improving basic reading and math skills</p>
<p>&bull; Generating an appropriate email</p>
<p>&bull; Working with various generations in the workplace</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>&bull; Rules of customer service</p>
<p>&bull; Exceeding expectations</p>
<p>&bull; Building and maintaining relationships</p>
<p>&bull; Problem solving and initiative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The employees will be energized after the seminar to put what they learn into action. They will be thinking about all of the topics discussed,&rdquo; said Dawn Busick, executive director of the workforce center.</p>
<p>The seminar will be held Dec. 1, 8:30 a.m. - 4:30 p.m. at the CWD office, 614 N. Washington Ave. The cost is $249 per person. Registration is open until Nov. 24.</p>
<p>Discounts are available for groups of 10 or more. The program can be customized for businesses and conducted at a company&rsquo;s location.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If a company doesn&rsquo;t have enough folks to cover their services and send people to the class, we can come on site with the program. We can customize the program to suit the company&rsquo;s needs depending on the subject. It can be in the retail area, the exchange of money and cash-register operation or communications, both written and verbal,&rdquo; Busick said.</p>
<p>This bottom line class will be offered on a continual basis.&nbsp;Call 417-447-8901 for the next available opening or go to http://www.otc.edu/workforce/workforce.php</p>

                    <p>By Steve Koehler</p>
<p>Ozarks Technical Community College&rsquo;s choir and instrumental ensemble will present an evening of music Dec. 10 at Stone Chapel on the Drury University campus.</p>
<p>Jennifer McAtee, instructor in the music department, said it will be the first time the college&rsquo;s ensemble will perform in public. The choir performed last year in a concert.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;The ensemble has been working toward the concert all semester. It&rsquo;s what they prepare for in class,&rdquo;&nbsp; she said. &ldquo;The Stone Chapel is a beautiful environment for this event.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ensemble will include guitar, clarinet, violin, viola and drums.</p>
<p>The concert, which begins at 7 p.m., is free and will include some holiday-themed selections along with some classical pieces, including one by Mozart. The choir and ensemble will each do five selections, McAtee said.</p>
<p>The students are members of the college&rsquo;s music department, Many of the students who are enrolled in the program either perform in local bands or are beginning their music studies at OTC before transferring to a four-year institution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nice niche here that caters to both types of musical students,&rdquo; McAtee said. &ldquo;The concert serves, in part, to let everyone know we have a music department here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For those who want a sneak preview of the upcoming performance or who can&rsquo;t make the concert, the ensemble will be performing tonight during the First Friday Art Walk.</p>
<p>Visitors can come to the third floor of the Gillioz Theater, where the Fine Arts Department is located, and hear some selections by the group. There is no charge for the student showcase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The showcase and concert are ways to expose the department to the public. The concert is also our way of giving something back to the community through music,&rdquo; McAtee said.</p>

                    <P>When the lights go up later this month on OTC's presentation of "Clue: The Musical," there will be some deep sighs of relief.</P>
<P>The effort of the College's Fine Arts Department to put on its first musical production in six years of stage performances has been filled with lots of hard work by students and faculty who decided to dip their toes into musical theater for the first time.</P>
<P>"There's a huge difference between a play and a musical production," said Jennifer McAtee, the production's music director. </P>
<P>"Theres some dialogue but there are 15 songs in the musical. Almost the entire production is sung. There's a huge amount of music. There are very few spaces where there isnt any singing."</P>
<P>For 16 weeks, students have been learning songs, dance moves, stage blocking and lines of dialogue in order to produce a successful production that's based on the popular board game.</P>
<P>Jeremy Lowther, at OTC student who plays one of the lead roles as Mr. Body, has musical theater experience and has been practicing at home in addition to the work hes put in at school.</P>
<P>"I started on this last semester but its better when you are working with everyone else," he said.</P>
<P>Everyone sings in the production, too, McAtee said, who will be playing the musical accompaniment on the piano at each performance &nbsp;all 175 pages of musical accompaniment.</P>
<P>"I've had to learn the music and teach it, too, but I've been practicing four hours a night. The music is tough but it's great. Its not boring music. There are some tangos and waltzes," she said.</P>
<P>Jon Herbert, the production's director, said he's excited about the idea of putting on a musical.</P>
<P>"Weve been wanting to do a musical. It's going to be a great production. The students have beautiful voices. Everything is coming together really well," he said.</P>
<P>Show times are April 26 and 27 at 7:30 p.m. and April 29 at 2:30 p.m. Tickets are $8 each. To purchase tickets, contact the Gillioz Box Office at 417-863-9491.</P><I>

                    <p>Next week marks hectic but happy times at Ozarks Technical Community College.</p>
<p>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a busy time at OTC with five graduation ceremonies taking place in four days involving nearly 2,000 students. It all starts with Thursday night&rsquo;s commencement exercise at JQH Arena and ends Sunday, May 16, with the graduation of students from the Middle College program.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a very happy time knowing that the graduates who are moving on to jobs or to further their education will be a permanent part of the OTC family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing more fulfilling than seeing students graduate. It not only marks their successful accomplishments here but also marks the start of a next chapter in their lives and an important component in the economic vitality of our area,&rdquo; said Dr. Hal Higdon, president of Ozarks Technical Community College.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> &ldquo;Everyone has played a part in these graduations, from the taxpayer to the parent. We should all be proud of what the students have done and congratulate them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&bull; Thursday&rsquo;s commencement begins at 6 p.m. The guest speaker will be Paul Sundy, a local business entrepreneur who graduated in 2001 from OTC.</p>
<p>Terry E. Mullins will be among those who will receive their degree next week. Terry, who was a mechanic and welder for 20 years, survived a horrible traffic accident 10 years ago.</p>
<p>The single father overcame the injuries suffered in the accident, came to OTC and will receive his associate&rsquo;s degree next week. He plans to continue his work toward a four-year degree in Mechanical Engineering.</p>
<p>&bull; The pinning of new registered nurses from this year&rsquo;s class of ASN graduates will be held Friday, May 14 at the Gillioz Theater at 6 p.m.</p>
<p>&bull; Two GED ceremonies will be held Sunday, May 16 at the Gillioz at 1 and 3 p.m.</p>
<p>&bull; The first graduation of OTC Middle College program will be at 6 p.m. after the GED ceremonies. A total of 20 students will graduate; 17 plan to go to college.</p>
<ul>

<p>The Middle College, the only one of its kind in the state, was created to help with Springfield R-12 school district&rsquo;s high-school dropout rate and targets underachieving students who have the potential to excel.

                    <p>This year&rsquo;s OTC Community Day promises to have more in store for everyone who attends.</p>
<p>In addition to the annual OTC Car and Motorcycle Show along with the popular Welding Day, visitors will also find helpful demonstrations and information about a variety of subjects from landscaping to food preparation.</p>
<p>The second annual Community Day will be April 30 on the Springfield campus from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Admission and parking is free.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Community Day was developed as a way for the college to give back to the community with programs, demonstrations and activities that visitors would find useful in their everyday lives,&rdquo; said Joel Doepker, college director of comunications and marketing</p>
<p>&ldquo;This year&rsquo;s event has been getting a lot of attention and interest around campus as more groups and programs are participating this year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The car show promises to be one of the largest ever with entry categories in a variety of styles, from original cars and trucks to street rods and modifies along with truck modifies.</p>
<p>The entry fee is $12 before the show and $15 on the day of the show. Rat Rods can be displayed for $8 but will they will not be judged.&nbsp; For registration information, call 447-8293 or go email Terry Pridgeon at pridgeot@otc.edu.</p>
<p>Visitors who need welding repairs can bring their items to the north side of the ITTC building, located near the southwest corner of Central Street and National Avenue.</p>
<p>Donations will be accepted in exchange for the repair work with the money going to charity.</p>
<p>The annual Turf and Landscape program&rsquo;s Plant Sale will take place that day with plenty of quality flowers and vegetable plants available for purchase. The program will conduct a water-gardening demonstration and offer lawn-mower-blade sharpening. Visitors are asked to just bring the blade, not the entire mower.</p>
<p>Students from the Allied Health dental program will be giving away toothbrushes, toothpaste and dental floss.</p>

                    <p>The idea behind Ozarks Technical Community College&rsquo;s first Community Day is very simple&mdash;give something back to the community.</p>
<p>In the past, events like the annual Car and Motorcycle Show and Free Welding Day were held separately, but on Saturday, those events plus lots more will be available for visitors to enjoy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are happy to give everyone a variety of activities and services at Community Day. We invite folks to come on campus and take a little time to enjoy everything we have planned for that day,&rdquo; said OTC President Hal L. Higdon.</p>
<p>Admission is free for the event that takes place from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the corner of the campus at National Avenue and Chestnut Expressway.</p>
<p>There will be a plant sale offered by the Turf and Landscape Management program along with free lawn mower blade sharpening. Just bring the blade, not the whole mower.</p>
<p>Allied Health will be offering health screenings and the Continuing Education Center will be there with demonstrations and offerings for adults and kids. A seat-belt demonstrator will give visitors first-hand experience about how important it is to use a seat belt.</p>
<p>The Springfield-Greene County Library Bookmobile will be on hand to issue library cards, give folks a chance to check out books and hand out giveaways to the kids.</p>
<p>Be sure to look for the actors from our upcoming Spring Play, &ldquo;Arthur&rsquo;s Stone, Merlin&rsquo;s Fire: The Making of a King.&rdquo; The cast will be putting on sword-fighting demonstrations that will be featured in the play that opens next weekend at the Gillioz Theater. Drawings will be held for free play tickets.</p>
<p>Of course, the car show and free welding day will be going on at the same time.</p>
<p>Visitors can bring their broken lawn furniture, grills, trailer hitches, wrought iron or other decorative pieces to the event to have them repaired for free. Donations are being taken for the March of Dimes.</p>
<p>Another highlight of Saturday&rsquo;s event will be the completed 1969 Chevy Chevelle, a replica of the car driven by local racer Dave Goldsberry, which was refurbished in part by the OTC Automotive Collision class. In addition to the public viewing, the vehicle&rsquo;s 550-horsepower engine will be started for the first time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They rehabbed the whole thing and got a chance to see what the old cars were like,&rdquo; said Kerry Wrinkle, department chair of OTC&rsquo;s transportation program.</p>

		<title>Composting program coming to OTC</title>

                    <p>By Steve Koehler</p>
<p>Ozarks Technical Community College will be getting into the composting business soon.</p>
<p>A new state-of-the-art composter, capable of producing as much as 2 tons of compost a day, will be constructed on campus as early as next spring with the material eventually being sold to the public, just like the city of Springfield and Dickerson Park Zoo do with their composting material.</p>
<p>The composter will be built by Custom Metalcraft and operated by SolSource Teknologi. OTC students from various programs, including welding, environmental sciences and turf and landscape management, will be involved in the project.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The companies came to us and asked about providing a place for the composter,&rdquo; said Shirley Lawler, vice president for academic affairs. &ldquo;The science faculty and those in turf and landscape management were very enthused about the prospect of bringing the composter here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>OTC has been mindful of campus waste and during Earth Day this year, students who belong to the campus group Society for the Awareness of the Natural Environment (SAME) conducted a waste audit on campus to determine how much garbage the school produced.</p>
<p>That information was shared with the two local sponsoring businesses as part of the research for bringing the composter to OTC.</p>
<p>Students in this summer&rsquo;s Biology 295 composting class are conducting additional surveys of residences and businesses within a mile of campus to determine how much food waste and wood scraps would be available to feed the composter.</p>
<p>Stephen White, biology professor at OTC who is conducting the summer class, said students are learning to collect and analyze data through their work on the surveys.</p>
<p>Lawler said the majority food scraps would come from the kitchens at OTC, Drury University, Central High School and the Greene County Jail.</p>
<p>White said the composting idea &ldquo;is a perfect fit for a community college.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It involves local companies, it&rsquo;s local composting and would help reduce the cost for some businesses who have to pay tipping fees to discard their food waste,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Said Lawler: &ldquo;The students would gain a better all around understanding of all aspects of composting from auditing the waste available to bagging it and selling it. It&rsquo;s a win-win for both programs and the businesses.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>Waynesville-area residents who are looking to further their education or sharpen their job-seeking skills have an opportunity to obtain such training this summer at Ozarks Technical Community College&rsquo;s Waynesville Education Center.</p>
<p>Some of these programs are a direct result of the current economic issues to retrain displaced workers or those needing additional work skills in order to compete for various jobs.</p>
<p>Beginning in June, a new computer user certificate program will begin at the Waynesville Center. This program is geared to help individuals hone their computer skills.</p>
<p>In just seven days, students will complete five classes, culminating in basic computer skills to navigate the Internet, use email, prepare documents, labels and envelopes and master some other basic computer skills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since this is our first summer semester in the area, we wanted to offer a varied schedule that would interest numerous residents. So far, we are very pleased with the response. Additionally, due to job losses and the current economic situation, we offer a wide array of courses that will help us respond quickly to the increasing demand for education and workforce training in the area,&rdquo; said Sue Moore, the College&rsquo;s Dean of Extended Campuses and College Outreach.</p>
<p>Each of the Continuing Education computer-related classes is generally a half-day or one-day class, with the longest meeting for a day and a half.</p>
<p>Those interested can save money by registering for the full certificate program. Use course number CEC 007-60 and save $40 off the individual course fees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Classes include:</p>
<p>&bull; Mouse &amp; Keyboard CEC 431-80: Monday, June 8 8:30a.m. - 3:30 p.m. and Tuesday, June 9, 8:30 a.m. - 12:30 p.m. $135.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>&bull; Basic Computer Level 1 CEC 200-80: Wednesday, June 10, 8:30 a.m. &ndash; 3:30 p.m. $99.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>&bull; Basic Computer Level 2 CEC-240-80: Thursday, June 11, 8:30 a.m. &ndash; 3:30 p.m. $99.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>&bull; Windows XP CEC 288-80: Friday, June 12, 8:30 a.m. &ndash; 3:30 p.m. $99.</p>
<p>&bull; Internet &amp; Email CEC 394-80. Monday, June 15, 8:30 a.m. &ndash; 3:30 p.m.&nbsp; $99.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>&bull; Windows File Management CEC 437-80. Tuesday, June 16, 8:30 a.m. &ndash; 12:30 p.m. $59.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>Books are required for most of the courses. To sign up call the Waynesville Education Center at (573) 774-5061 or go online to www.otc.edu/continuinged and follow the instructions to register or call the Springfield campus at (417) 447-8888.</p>
<p>Other Continuing Education classes coming to the Waynesville Center include: Medical Claims Analyst (coding, terminology, billing and insurance), a certificate program in cake decoration, foreign languages and electrical updates. Suggestions for additional course topics may be sent to: pattersd@otc.edu.</p>
<p>In addition to the specialized classes, registration for the dozens of summer and fall semester course offerings is occurring at the Waynesville Center.</p>
<p>Moore said she was excited about the area&rsquo;s response to the new Waynesville Center, which will mark its first anniversary of operation this fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clearly, there was a need for a public community college in the region. The College, through collaboration with the community leaders, found a way to develop a partnership to fill this need. It is exhilarating to be a part of this community,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enrollment in the first fall semester surpassed all of our projections with over 120 students and this trend continued during the spring semester. I don&rsquo;t see that changing in the near future. As enrollment continues to increase, we will need to develop a plan for expanding the facility and hiring additional staff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moore said the long-term future for the College and the Waynesville Center looks bright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Within the next five years, I would not be surprised if we have outgrown the current facility. &nbsp;Opportunities and challenges are abundant in the region. We look forward to continued collaboration with our local educational partners to provide affordable, convenient, high quality higher education,&rdquo; she said.</p>

		<title>Construction projects finished in time for fall semester</title>

                    <p>With the start of the new fall semester fast approaching, the finishing touches are being put on several major construction projects in the Ozarks Technical Community College system.</p>
<p>At the OTC Springfield campus, the major remodeling of ICW 100, which included the creation of 10 new classrooms, a fitness center and storage for the OTC Bookstore, is finished and will be ready when classes resume Aug. 22.</p>
<p>The overhaul also includes several faculty offices and a student study area.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We continue to expand to meet the needs of students, faculty and staff. We want to stay one step ahead of what everyone needs and the No. 1 need is classroom seats,&rdquo; said Rob Rector, vice chancellor of administrative services.</p>
<p>Other projects that were completed on the Springfield campus include a new Electronic Media Production laboratory, a science lab for the Middle College program and the conversion of ICW 350 into a developmental learning lab.</p>
<p>The College also completed the renovation of two donated buildings in Lebanon to create the OTC Lebanon Center on Highway MM near St. John&rsquo;s Hospital. The College had previously been offering classes in the Nelson Education Center in Lebanon.</p>
<p>Classes will be held in Casey Hall, named after Reuben and Mary Lou Casey of San Clemente, Calif., who donated the two buildings and more than 13 acres of land to OTC. The total property is valued at approximately $2.6 million and is the largest gift the college has ever received.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Casey Hall will be home to 13 new classrooms, computer labs, a student lounge and a student services department in Lebanon. A branch of the OTC Bookstore along with a Center for Workforce Development office will be located in the other building on the campus.</p>
<p>Jeff Kulbach, director of the Lebanon center, said the staff couldn&rsquo;t wait for the semester to start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over the months, we&rsquo;ve been closely involved in the initial planning, design, infill construction and set up of the new buildings. We are very excited to be offering residents a new location and expanded classes in this new facility,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>But the completion of these projects does not signal an end to construction projects at OTC.</p>
<p>Up next is the construction of the OTC Table Rock campus Hollister, which is expected to be completed in the fall of 2013 and a new facility in Waynesville, which also is expected to be completed about the same time at Table Rock.</p>

                    <p>By Steve Koehler</p>
<p>Ozarks Technical Community College&rsquo;s Continuing Education Center is adding a number of new community safety programs aimed at the educational and training needs of businesses, families and individuals. The new programs include:</p>
<p>&bull; Child and Infant Car Seat Restraint/Safety and Compliance</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>&bull; Bicycle Safety</p>
<p>&bull; Safe Teen and Senior Drivers</p>
<p>The center is looking to concentrate on car seat safety and talking to high-school aged drivers about drunk drinking at all driver&rsquo;s education programs in Greene and Christian counties.</p>
<p>Other safety programs that are continuing, include the motorcycle safety program, where interested individuals learn to ride a motorcycle under the supervision of state-trained instructors, and the CPR/Automated External Defibrillator (AED) training for the AED-Center of Excellence that assists area businesses to keep their AEDs functional and inspected as well as provide employee training.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OTC is actively responding to the requests in our community to provide more safety programs. We also offer CPR training to healthcare providers, community members and youth. The motorcycle safety program has provided state approved training to nearly 200 new riders so far this season.&rdquo; said Dana Thorp Patterson, director of Continuing Education.</p>
<p>A community safety specialist from Continuing Education will oversee the new and existing safety programs.</p>
<p>The motorcycle safety course, conducted in conjunction with the Motorcycle Safety Foundation, trains riders and tests the participant&rsquo;s skills to receive their certification as an approved motorcycle operator in the state of Missouri.</p>
<p>Seats are available in the motorcycle safety classes scheduled through November and the CPR/AED training is available upon request.</p>
<p>For more information about these programs, call the Continuing Education Center at (417) 447-8888.</p>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>Jennifer and Matthew Glossip had one tiny, but important, reason for getting their General Education Diplomas (GEDs) this year.</p>
<p>Her name is Jemma, the Glossips&rsquo; six-month-old baby daughter. She was the motivation for the husband and wife, who had dropped out of high school several years ago but returned to class to earn their diplomas.</p>
<p>The two received their GEDs together Sunday at Ozarks Technical Community College&rsquo;s graduation ceremony at the Gillioz Theater.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did it for Jemma. It was very important for us. We want her to be proud of us,&rdquo; Jennifer Glossip said.</p>
<p>The couple dropped out of high school for different reasons. Jennifer, 20, left Buffalo High School because she was pregnant and wanted to start a family with Matthew, also 20, who left Glendale High School when he was a sophomore.</p>
<p>The couple studied for their GEDs at the Missouri Career Center in Springfield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our first priority was finishing school. I regret not finishing before,&rdquo; Jennifer Glossip said.</p>
<p>The couple has set goals for their future. Jennifer wants to become a teacher and Matthew wants to run his own business. Both plan to start attending OTC. Graduates receive a three-credit-hour scholarship for a class at OTC after earning their GED.</p>
<p>But their biggest and most important goal is stressing to Jemma the importance of an education.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to show her that going to school and getting an education is the most important thing you can do,&rdquo; Jennifer Glossip said.</p>
<p>The Glossips were among more than 300 graduates who received their diplomas Sunday. More than 100 took part in the ceremony in which guest speaker Rodney Loomer, a Springfield attorney, challenged the graduates not to stop getting their education.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You decided to change your life. You&rsquo;re on a roll now. Make it your goal to continue your education,&rdquo; Loomer said.</p>
<p>Michelle Gray of Springfield plans to continue her education after receiving her diploma Sunday.</p>
<p>Gray said her layoff from Willow Brook Foods in the fall was &ldquo;a blessing in disguise&rdquo; and gave her a chance to improve her life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was hard work and I&rsquo;m proud of me. I was scared at first returning to school. It was the first time since 1986,&rdquo; said the married mother of four.</p>
<p>Robin Willis of Seymour, who dropped out of high school more than 20 years ago, drove almost 75 miles round trip nearly every day in order to complete her GED work and also took college courses at OTC while studying for her diploma.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just going to see where it takes me,&rdquo; Willis said.</p>

                    <p>Melissa and David Lyday know that someday soon the education they received at Ozarks Technical Community College and elsewhere will be put to use in Ecuador.</p>
<p>The recently wedded couple from Bolivar will be leaving soon to establish a medical clinic in the country&rsquo;s capital city of Quito to offer aid and assistance to the poor who have limited access to medical care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I first went there, I saw that the healthcare system was not very good. To see a doctor took a long time. People waited in line for days and if you left the line, you lost your place and had to go to the back of the line,&rdquo; said Melissa Lyday, who has made several missionary trips to the country as well as to Mexico.</p>
<p>It was during those short mission trips to Ecuador that Melissa and David knew they needed to do something for the people there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Melissa knew when she was there that it was where we needed to be. We feel that for now, this is where God is leading us,&rdquo; David Lyday said.</p>
<p>Melissa Lyday has earned her Certified Nursing Assistant certificate through OTC&rsquo;s hybrid CNA course and may soon enroll in the certificate program for Electrocardiography.<strong></strong></p>
<p>The couple is taking a Spanish class this semester at OTC. David is attending Southwest Baptist to work on his doctorate in physical therapy.</p>
<p>The couple has known each other since middle school and were married last July. They honeymooned in Ecuador, even though it was more of a mission trip than a honeymoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We went to service people. We&rsquo;ve been wanting to do this for a long time and now we will,&rdquo; said Melissa Lyday, who works at the YMCA in Bolivar.</p>
<p>While there is no timetable, the couple wants to finish their education, pay off their student loans and then head for their new country. That should take no more than a few years, they said.</p>
<p>Melissa Lyday said both her and David&rsquo;s families have given their blessing to the couple&rsquo;s endeavor even though they don&rsquo;t know how long they will stay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe forever,&rdquo; she said with a smile. &ldquo;Or, until we&rsquo;re told to do something else.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>By Steve Koehler</p>
<p>Opportunity can come out of nowhere and when it did for Ozarks Technical Community College graduate Ric Ramos, he took full advantage of his chance.</p>
<p>A 2009 spring graduate of OTC&rsquo;s culinary arts program, one of the top programs offered at the College, Ramos landed a job cooking in a top restaurant in New York City by simply asking if there were any job openings.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just any high-end restaurant in New York. It&rsquo;s Morimoto, a&nbsp; restaurant owned by Masaharu Morimoto, one of the stars of the Food Network&rsquo;s &ldquo;Iron Chef&rdquo; series.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t expect to see Ramos on television working for the Iron Chef.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not thinking about television. I&rsquo;m here to get as much experience as I can. I work hard and give it my all every day,&rdquo; Ramos said in an interview from New York.</p>
<p>During spring break of 2009, Ramos went to New York for a job interview at Jean Georges Restaurant but his hopes were diminished when he found there were 20 other applicants.</p>
<p>He left to have lunch at Morimoto&rsquo;s restaurant, and told the manager he was looking for work. The manager asked to see Ramos&rsquo; resume. The head chef gave the OTC graduate a one-day tryout and he was hired.</p>
<p>Ramos, who moved to Springfield from the Philippines five years ago, graduated from OTC on May 15 and was working in New York June 1.</p>
<p>The 21-year-old Glendale High School graduate picked up his culinary experience at OTC and working as a teenager at various restaurants, including Nakato Japanese Restaurant in Springfield, where his father works.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was an exceptional student. He had an overwhelming interest to learn everything he could about the subject he was taught. He asked the right questions. He was a very hard worker. He had a great work ethic,&rdquo; said Lisa Gardner, department chair for OTC&rsquo;s Culinary Arts and Hospitality Management program.</p>
<p>Chef George Southwick, the Culinary Arts chief instructor, said Ramos had a lot of family support when he was a student at OTC.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was impressed with his family. He was a good student and a top quality person,&rdquo; Southwick said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;The people at Nakato wanted to help Ric and let him really shine. Ric is one of those people who always went the extra mile. I&rsquo;m not surprised he found success in New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ramos has done well at Morimoto and has moved up to working the cold appetizer station, the saut&eacute; station and the grill station, while at the same time, honing his skills in sushi making.</p>
<p>He wants to eventually be an executive chef at a five-star hotel. He&rsquo;s not thinking about appearing on TV with Morimoto on the Food Network.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I want to do right now. I want to get as much experience as I can,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Ramos is grateful for the help the culinary arts program gave him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It helps when you go to school. It gives you ideas so when you are working in the real world, you can apply those ideas. School gives you the good basic knowledge,&rdquo; he said, adding that he&rsquo;s not sure what the future holds for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I still have a long way to go so I&rsquo;m going to reach my goals one step at a time and I&rsquo;m going to try the best I can in order to be successful.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>The Culinary Arts program at Ozarks Technical Community College has been granted accreditation from the American Culinary Federation Education Foundation (ACF).</p>
<p>The accreditation, approved earlier this year, is valid until Dec. 31, 2012.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Culinary faculty, led by department chair Lisa Gardner, has worked hard to build a quality program at OTC. &nbsp;An integral part of an excellent culinary program is ACF accreditation. We are very proud of our outstanding chefs and the culinary department at OTC and congratulate them on this accomplishment,&rdquo; said Dr. Shirley Lawler, OTC&rsquo;s Vice president of Academic Affairs.</p>
<p>The accreditation helps a culinary arts program ensure that the program has established high standards, developed efficient accountability and credibility, as well as offers a high level of professionalism and up-to-date practices to its students.</p>

                    <P>Taking a classroom to a real-world setting isn't easy but when done correctly it's a win-win for the student and the business.</P>
<P>OTC's culinary arts program has taken its first step in offering students that practical work experience this summer in an arrangement reached between the college and owner of Vintage Veranda Team Room at 724 S. Scenic.</P>
<P>After program director Lisa Gardner and owner Patty Wingo talked it over, the two decided the nine students in a summer culinary class could come to work at the restaurant for two weeks. The work ends June 21.</P>
<P>The culinary program does operate a student-run restaurant once a week in the fall and winter semesters on the Springfield campus but the summer pilot program will come practical experience.</P>
<P>"Students will be taking orders from someone else and preparing dishes from a menu they didn't design. It should be interesting," Gardner said.</P>
<P>Wingo said having the students was a good fit for her establishment and the students.</P>
<P>"I love the idea. I'm pumped. I want their ideas on marketing and the menu. It's a teaching moment for me," she said.</P>
<P>The students are divided between working the front of the house as wait staff and managers and the back of the house in the kitchen.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Richard Hicks, part of the wait staff, said he was anxious to take part in the class.</P>
<P>"I really wanted to be a part and jumped at the idea of working here. I'm glad I took the summer class," he said. </P>
<P>Tracye Corbin, who was working as one of the managers, enrolled in the culinary program after her parents retired from their business.</P>
<P>"I've wanted to cook forever. My first job in high school was working for a catering company," she said.</P>
<P>Gardner said the pilot program could become a regular course on the schedule.</P>
<P>"We are testing the waters right now but there is a benefit to partnering up with another restaurant and we will be looking into that. It's good work experience for the students,' she said.</P>

		<title>Culinary students still buzzing about cooking for Crow </title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
                    
                    <p>Mark Dandurand and Nathan Frazo still have smiles on their faces a week after experiencing the biggest moment in their young culinary careers.</p>
<p>Last week, the two Ozarks Technical Community College students were asked to assist Sheryl Crow&rsquo;s personal chef in preparing the rock star&rsquo;s pre-concert meal before her performance at Drury University.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awesome doesn&rsquo;t even describe it,&rdquo; said Nathan, who cooks at the Clarion Hotel in addition to going to culinary school at OTC.</p>
<p>The two students were picked after Crow&rsquo;s personal chef, Chuck White, contacted Lisa Gardner, director of OTC&rsquo;s culinary arts program. White routinely contacts culinary schools in the city where Crow is playing to ask for help in preparing the meal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think twice. I said, &lsquo;Sure, I&rsquo;ll do it,&rsquo;&rdquo; Mark said.</p>
<p>Mark and Nathan won national SkillsUSA honors last month for their culinary abilities. Mark took second place in culinary arts and Nathan was seventh in the nation in commercial baking, which came in handy in cooking for Crow, 15 others and three children.</p>
<p>The meal was prepared in a conference room in the O&rsquo;Reilly Family Center where the concert was held. Chef White brings a portable kitchen with him to prepare Crow&rsquo;s meals, who started eating healthier after battling breast cancer a few years ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were a pretty easy group to cook for,&rdquo; said Mark, who cooks at the Twin Oaks Country Club.</p>
<p>The three-course meal consisted of a fried green tomato BLT with the grilled tomato serving as the bun; a rib eye steak with smoked tomato sauce; roasted vegetables and potatoes; and for dessert, a strawberry panna cotta with a strawberry-blueberry sauce.</p>
<p>Nathan&rsquo;s award-winning bakery skills were put to the test making the panna cotta.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never made one before but I did it. They ate it,&rdquo; he said with a smile.</p>
<p>Nathan also served the group, including Crow, who didn&rsquo;t engage in a lot of conversation with the OTC student but ate all of her meal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said &lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; and said the food was great. As soon as she finished eating, she went backstage to get ready for the concert,&rdquo; Nathan said.</p>
<p>The experience has left the students thinking about doing more with their careers than just cooking in restaurants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d like to travel and cook for celebrities,&rdquo; Mark said.&nbsp; &ldquo;That would be pretty fantastic.&rdquo;</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
                    
                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>Ozarks Technical Community College will become the first college in the country to offer training in a new cutting-edge security software program.</p>
<p>Russell Campbell, lead instructor for CompTIA A+ Certification Training at OTC, said the College&rsquo;s network technology program will soon offer classes in the installation and configuration of FastAccess, a powerful biometric facial recognition software program developed by Sensible Vision of Covert, Mich.</p>
<p>The company said the College is the first academic institution in the country to use the software as an instruction tool for training.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are leading the way in introducing technology into the classroom and networking training. We are continually striving to offer the latest in hardware and software combining it with the best training available. Yet, the training and equipment is offered at the lowest cost per credit hour of any school in the area,&rdquo; Campbell said.</p>
<p>The software uses facial recognition instead of forcing users to constantly type their account information at the logon screen. With the program, users simply access the computer and FastAccess will authenticate them and log them on in less than two seconds.</p>
<p>Once they leave the computer will lock. FastAccess will automatically unlock the computer when they come back and return the desktop as they left it. If another authorized user steps up to the computer, FastAccess can switch accounts for the new user.</p>
<p>The software has the ability to learn and adapt to a user&rsquo;s facial changes including beard growth and hairstyle changes. In some cases, in if a user wears glasses one day and contacts the next, it may ask the user for a password if the face isn&rsquo;t recognized.</p>
<p>Facial-recognition software is used in the medical and financial fields where access to records and sensitive material has to be secure. Government agencies like the FBI and CIA also use similar software.</p>
<p>Students will learn how to setup the software and test its functionality, Campbell said.</p>
<p>Campbell said the software training will be a boost for network technology students.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This training puts our students ahead of most of the people they will be competing with for employment. Our passing rate for certification proves the quality of the training and students. Many of our students are employed around the community and here at OTC. Security is a big area of study now,&rdquo; he said</p>

<p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst">A six-week online crisis and disaster management program will be offered next month for current and potential emergency management personnel across the country, from the public and private sector.</p>
<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">The program was born out of conversations last year between Greene County Emergency Management representatives and Ozarks Technical Community College. Both organizations found it difficult to find well-trained personnel to fill key crisis and disaster management positions.</p>
<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">&ldquo;Because the need was not limited to our immediate region, we knew we needed a flexible solution that could accommodate a variety of schedules and locations.&nbsp; OTC has a tremendous online college department, so we teamed with them for the optimum solution,&rdquo; said Cindy Stephens, assistant executive director of OTC&rsquo;s Center for Workforce Development.</p>
<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">After talking with crisis and disaster management experts, CWD and OTC Online developed an online six-course certificate program. No on-campus visits are required.</p>
<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">&ldquo;By offering the classes online, people can participate in any time zone at any hour of the day or night,&rdquo; said Vanessa Germeroth, assistant director for eLearning Outreach.&nbsp; &ldquo;The content is as valuable and relevant for someone in Springfield or Carthage as it is for someone in California or Alabama.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">Course topics include Emergency Preparedness and Planning, Exercise Design and Evaluation, Understanding Terrorism and Political Violence, Risk Assessment and Analysis, Disaster Response and Disaster Recovery and Mitigation.</p>
<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">The initial course, Emergency Preparedness and Planning, begins March 7.</p>
<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">Ryan Nicholls, Greene County director of emergency management, will teach the first course.</p>
<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">&ldquo;The course will lay out the basic principals of emergency management coordination. It is designed for those in the profession, both in the public and private sector. It&rsquo;s also for those who might be required to meet certain training requirements or for those who are thinking about getting into this line of work. It should be a great program,&rdquo; said Nicholls, an OTC graduate.</p>
<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">Those planning to apply for FEMA positions or who hold government-based emergency management jobs can gain professional development credits by completing a single course or the entire program.</p>
<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">The fee for each course is $499, or $2,495 if a person registers for all six.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;">For information about the program, contact Cindy Stephens at <a href="mailto:stephenc@otc.edu">stephenc@otc.edu</a>. Course details can be found at <a href="http://www.otc.edu/workforce/15291.php">http://www.otc.edu/workforce/15291.php</a></p>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>For those who find themselves out of work or in need of more training to get a new job, Ozarks Technical Community College offers a potent one-two punch with offerings from both our Center for Workforce Development and Continuing Education Center.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a look at both departments and how they might be able to help you.</p>
<p><strong>Center for Workforce Development</strong></p>
<p>The Center, with the recent addition of Dawn Busick as its executive director, has taken on a new attitude and new mindset when it comes to the technical education it offers for the workforce that make up the region&rsquo;s business and industry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Education is the core of creating wealth. &nbsp;It is my tenured experience in economic development and workforce development has taught me an abundant talent pipeline possessing educational attainment and skills is what makes a region, a community and a state globally competitive,&rdquo; Ms. Busick says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The closer the skills of the labor pool align with the skills required by the economy, the more competitive the region will be.&nbsp;Demands for timely educational offerings, demands for meeting current and future employer needs, and demands for high technology educational delivery methods. &nbsp;I am excited and honored to serve OTC and Missouri's southwest region.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For businesses looking for ways to keep their workforce up-to-date with the latest techniques, training methods and innovations in their fields, the Center for Workforce Development has plenty to offer.</p>
<p>Courses in leadership development, manufacturing solutions and OSHA-certified training are all on the Center&rsquo;s menu of available courses.</p>
<p>For the individual, the Workforce Center offers individuals job potential at its Transport Training Institute with students getting a chance to become a licensed commercial truck driver in as little as five weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Continuing Education Center</strong></p>
<p>The Center offers courses for jobs in the fields of healthcare, computer technology and early childcare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OTC and the Continuing Education Center offer a number of certificate training programs that will get you ready to go to work immediately,&rdquo; said Dana Patterson, director of the Continuing Education Center.</p>
<p>The noncredit healthcare programs meet needs of individuals seeking quality, affordable programs that train them for a specific job and do so in a matter of weeks. <br /> &nbsp;<br /> &bull; The Certified Nurse Assistant program meets for 8 weeks for class time and clinical hours.</p>
<p>&bull; Pharmacy Technician and Phlebotomy Technician generally meet for a full semester one night per week, but this summer, they are both being offered in a condensed 7-week program, meeting twice per week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Most classes meet in the evenings, allowing an individual to work at their regular job during the day and train to move into a professional position by night. CNA is offered in both formats, day classes and evening classes. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> &bull; An 11-week Medical Claims Analyst program is available for those interested in healthcare billing.</p>
<p>&bull; Computer technology enrollment is on the rise for individuals seeking improved skills to gain access for interviews or in preparation to meet new demands and be more competitive in the workforce.</p>
<p>Continuing Education offers classes for the very beginner who needs basic skills to be able to search for work and complete online applications to those needing high-end technical training. The flexibility of the schedules allows individuals to take courses at day in one-day sections, by night or even on weekends.</p>
<p>&bull; The Child Care Associate Credential has been increasingly in demand, as more and more facilities require their employees to be credentialed. The program consists of 120 classroom hours, assistance in preparing a professional portfolio and observation of work skills. National accreditation is gained upon completion of this program.</p>

                    <p>Cami Zapata has held a number of jobs in her lifetime but never felt like she had a career. That is, until today.</p>
<p>The 45-year-old is attending college for the first time, studying to earn an associate degree from OTC in respiratory therapy and a certificate in pharmacy technician.</p>
<p>Two of her daughters currently attend OTC and inspired their mother to enroll in classes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After seeing what my family could do with a good education and watching them going after their dreams, I decided it was time for me to build onto my experiences. I never tried college. It&rsquo;s been an experience. I know whatever I finish will only benefit me in several ways,&rdquo; said Zapata.</p>
<p>The Springfield resident operated a home daycare for 14 years and also worked in the medical field, in retail sales, in a pharmacy and as an office worker. While she enjoyed the work, she kept looking for something that was more than just a job. She wanted a career.</p>
<p>Her daughter Cassie, 22, is studying graphic arts, and Cheyenne, 16, a junior at Glendale High School, is studying electronic media production through the OTC Career Center. Both of them urged their mother to enroll at OTC to find a career.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wanted to go further with her education in the medical field so we encouraged her to go into whatever she wanted and we&rsquo;re very proud of her,&rdquo; Cassie Zapata said.</p>
<p>Cami Zapata, who is not working now, credits her husband and children with helping through her new life as a student.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are a close family. I don&rsquo;t think I would have gone back if it wasn&rsquo;t for them. When I said I was going to try it, they all said, &lsquo;Go for it.&rsquo; I am, and thanks to them, I&rsquo;ll succeed,&rdquo; she said.</p>

                    <P>Chris Lehew lost his ability to hear when he contracted spinal meningitis when he was 16 months old.</P>
<P>Today, as a facilities worker at the OTC Springfield Campus, Lehew is at peace with not having the ability to hear at all or verbalize very much.</P>
<P>"'I'm proud of who I am. I don't see any reason to fix my hearing. It's gone. That's fine. I like who I am," he said through a sign language interpreter.</P>
<P>Lehew has been working at OTC since 2013 when he was a part-time employee; he became a full-time staff member in 2014.</P>
<P>His duties include keeping the kitchens in the Information Commons West wing clean.</P>
<P>"The kitchen is fantastic," he said. "I'm able to use my time adequately in there. I keep busy. There's no possibility of sitting down in there. I'm always working, always busy. I like working on the floor and keeping it clean. Keeping it spick and span."</P>
<P>There aren't many obstacles to being deaf and working on the facilities staff. Communication is not an issue. He said he puts messages and statements on a white board in the kitchen to let co-workers and supervisors know where he is and what he's doing.</P>
<P>"We write back and forth or we can use a phone with a notepad app on the phone," he said. "I also have an app that if I type it, the phone will speak what I type. It gives me a voice." </P>
<P>Lehew said OTC has been very welcoming to him.</P>
<P>"People at OTC are very friendly here. 'm really impressed with that because people here at OTC want to be successful just as everyone else is whether they are hearing, deaf, have cerebral palsy, are disabled or blind, it doesnt matter," he said. </P>
<P>"I feel like we're on an even playing field here and they are really very encouraging. I don't feel frustrated. They work as a team here and I like that."</P>
<P>As far as the future goes, Lehew has no plans at the moment.</P>
<P>"I'm really concentrating on tomorrow. I'm not looking to the future," he said. "It's a day at a time and then I'll address tomorrow as it happens."</P><I>
<P> </P></I>

		<title>Dean has fun in hockey world</title>

                    <P>At first glance, one would never mistake Vivian Elder for someone who enjoys the rough and tumble sport of hockey.</P>
<P>But Elder, OTC's dean of academic services and a former ballerina, is addicted to the sport that she just started playing 10 years ago. Today, she is a league player and has shared the ice with well-known former and current St. Louis Blues hockey players.</P>
<P>"I was very quiet and introverted," said Elder, a Springfield native who attended Greenwood High School and Missouri State University. "In hockey, you stand up for yourself. I wish I would have taken it up earlier."</P>
<P>Elder, who started teaching full-time at OTC in 2005, didn't know how to skate when she stepped onto the ice to follow her husband, Shaun, who was a high school hockey player who grew up in Utah and plays hockey when the Mediacom Ice Rink opened.</P>
<P>"He was playing and it was just me sitting in the stands freezing, watching him," she said. "We would go hang out afterwards. I was thinking they burnt calories and I sat on an uncomfortable bench in the freezing cold, so in 2005, I decided to buy equipment and start to play."</P>
<P>She joined a team and just threw herself on the ice to learn to skate and play.</P>
<P>"It wasn't fun for the first year. I wasn't good at it," she said. "Then, it became fun."</P>
<P>But there were growing pains. Like the time she broke her collarbone defending her husband during a game.</P>
<P>"Someone was being a jerk to my husband. The refs didn't do anything about it," she said. "Like a dork, I decided to skate at the player as hard as I could. I went to give him a shoulder. He moved and I hit the glass and the bone shattered like a pencil."</P>
<P>She became such a fan of the game that Elder and her husband annually travel to St. Louis to take part in Blues fantasy camps, playing games with former players like Larry Patey and Bernie Federko and current Blues player Paul Stasny</P>
<P>"Id recommend the sport to others. It can really be fun," she said.</P>

                    <!-- @font-face {   font-family: "Cambria"; }@font-face {   font-family: "American Typewriter"; }p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal { margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: "Times New Roman"; }a:link, span.MsoHyperlink { color: blue; text-decoration: underline; }a:visited, span.MsoHyperlinkFollowed { color: purple; text-decoration: underline; }div.Section1 { page: Section1; } -->
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The Ozarks Technical Community College Dental Hygiene Clinic is going green to save some green.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Recent additions of new equipment and supplies have helped the department become more environmentally friendly and save money in the long run.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The program is saving a considerable amount of money due to the decrease or elimination of paper charts, x-ray film and chemicals, reusable sterilization items, and lowered lighting voltage. The overall savings is estimated at about $2,700 annually.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just begun implementing these greener ideas and as far as cost savings, our ordering of materials has dramatically decreased, which is saving taxpayer money,&rdquo; said Lisa Hunter, clinic supervisor for the dental hygiene program.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Over the past months, the lab has been converted into a digital x-ray lab, which allows for instantaneous x-rays to be available. Traditional x-rays are still being used about 20 percent of the time to allow students to learn that technique still practiced in many dental offices.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The amount of radiation a patient is exposed to is reduced by half and the x-rays appear on a computer screen attached to the patient&rsquo;s chair. Since the x-ray is digital, it can be enlarged or a part of it can be isolated to look closer at a single part of a tooth.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&ldquo;More dentists are going digital and upgrading their technology. Our students are learning that process here and are ready for those offices,&rdquo; Hunter said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>In addition to big changes, smaller adjustments are being made in the lab that began when a patient noticed trash cans were full every day.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&ldquo;The amount of waste was something that had to be remedied,&rdquo; Hunter said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Today, those same waste cans have little, if any, trash in them, thanks to some of the changes being made.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Hunter said the department has just scratched the surface in looking a greening opportunities in the department.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&ldquo;We are constantly looking for things to do to save money for the students and the community we serve and make the program more environmentally sound,&rdquo; she said.</span></p>

		<title>Dollars flow from OTC to community</title>

                    <p>Ceng Lee, a second-year student from Cassville, is a perfect example of how out-of-district students contribute economically to the area when they come to Ozarks Technical Community College.</p>
<p>Lee moved to Springfield to attend OTC. She spends money she earns working at the Battlefield Mall on rent, gas, food, clothes and entertainment while living here and getting her education.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to eat out. I eat out a lot. I like to shop. It takes a lot of money,&rdquo; said Lee, 20, who is studying to become a dental hygienist.</p>
<p>She is one of more than 4,000 out-of-district students who contribute more than $11.6 million annually to OTC&rsquo;s service region economy, especially in and around Springfield.</p>
<p>The amount of money out-of-district students spend annually is included in a recent independent economic impact report that shows the actual economic contribution OTC is making to the region.</p>
<p>The report shows that OTC contributes more than $211 million each year to the region through a combination of college operations, student spending and productivity of graduates in the workforce.</p>
<p>In addition to the $11.6 million spent by out-of-district students, another $31.6 million comes from spending through OTC operations.</p>
<p>On top of that, $168.6 million has been added to the economy annually by increased productivity of former students who received their training and education they received at the college.</p>
<p>The report also shows that state dollars that come to the college are shown to be a sound investment.</p>
<p>OTC receives $20.3 million in state appropriations and local taxes and the community receives $40.9 million back over the course of students' careers, in the form of increased tax revenue and avoided social costs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our impact has been felt in Springfield and throughout southwest Missouri for many years,&rdquo; said Dr. Hal Higdon, president of the college.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Until last week, Jeff Jochems had never stepped foot outside the U.S.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But now, the president of the OTC Richwood Valley campus can show a passport stamped with the country Brazil in it after spending a week in the South American country on a weeklong education mission representing the state&rsquo;s community colleges.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;Brazil has a pretty robust university system, but it&rsquo;s mostly private and is based on selective admissions. They don&rsquo;t have anything like a community college at all. The country wants to expand opportunities for students in that area in addition to attracting U.S. students to their universities,&rdquo; Jochems said before leaving for the trip Oct. 12.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A number of representatives from different universities and colleges, along with ministers of education, were planning to meet with Jochems and 10 other representatives of the state&rsquo;s colleges and universities.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Jochems has been with OTC for 21 years and has been president of the Richwood Valley campus since 2011.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The group visited three Brazilian cities with anywhere from 15-20 meetings scheduled. Two of the cities will serve as venues for the Summer Olympics in 2016.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In addition to meeting Brazil&rsquo;s education officials, the group was also scheduled to meet with officials from the U.S. ambassador&rsquo;s office in Brazil.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;There was interest in having an education trip, and at the governor&rsquo;s request, the main focus of this trip is education, although some representatives from the state&rsquo;s Department of Economic Development are going, too,&rdquo; Jochems said before the trip.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Being the only representative of the state&rsquo;s community college system, Jochems said he was not sure what to expect in the way of questions from the representatives from Brazil.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;You never know what they may or may not bring up. It may surround the kind of training we offer at the community college level or what can be done from a cooperative aspect,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;They may want to know how we operate with an open admissions policy. I may get more about one area than the other. It will be interesting what kind of questions I get.&rdquo;</p>

                    <div class="pr_imagewrapper">/Shirley_Lawler_5X7.jpg</div>
                    <p>Dr. Shirley Lawler has plenty of things to be proud of when looking back on her educational career.</p>
<p>Not only has she had an outstanding academic tenure, she also is a first-generation college and high-school graduate.</p>
<p>But the one thing she is proudest of is what she&rsquo;s witnessed during her 15 1/2-year career at Ozarks Technical Community College.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve changed lives,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Lawler is retiring as Provost/Vice Chancellor for Academic and Student Affairs at OTC. She has been in working in education since1982 when she was hired for a teacher in the Lebanon school district. Two years later, she moved to the Logan-Rogersville School District.</p>
<p>While at Rogersville, Lawler became involved in the newly created state A+ Program that led to her meeting then-OTC President Dr. Norman Myers. That association eventually led to Lawler coming to OTC to run a grant for the School-To-Work program.</p>
<p>Lawler, a native of Wright County, has held various positions at OTC including dean of academic services and dean of technical education. In 2010 she was named to her current position.</p>
<p>Reflecting on her career at OTC, Lawler considers herself fortunate to be at the college during a time of expansion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody should be this lucky to sit here for 15 years and watch OTC grow like it has. I remember wading through the mud when most of this was just a plot of land and going into the first technical building. To see all of this being built up out of the center city of Springfield is just remarkable. Everyone should work somewhere like here,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>For Lawler, all of the college&rsquo;s progress begs the question: Where will OTC be 15 years from now?</p>
<p>&ldquo;A shift in technology is taking place here and it has to take place in online and hybrid courses. We will have multiple campuses with large enrollments and strong programs,&rdquo; Lawler said.</p>
<p>But at its core, the job of OTC will remain the same &mdash;&nbsp;educating and helping students, said Lawler, who will be teaching several courses at the OTC Richwood Valley campus in the fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every day, we change students&rsquo; lives. I&rsquo;ve seen it and will continue to see it as long as OTC exists,&rdquo; she said.</p>

		<title>Driving simulator helps in training drivers</title>

                    <P></P>
<P>At first glance, the trio of oversized TV screens, an oversized operator's seat and authentic mobile ambulance may all look like some elaborate video game setup.</P>
<P>But what the system actually is used for is serious business, teaching emergency personnel and law enforcement officers the ins and outs of defensive driving in a safe way.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Housed in OTC's Center for Workforce Development, the driving simulator gives users a chance to drive in a variety of emergency conditions that, until now, could only be experienced in real life as they happened.</P>
<P></P>
<P>New software gives users a chance to "drive" an ambulance to an emergency or give a law enforcement officer the experience of chasing a suspect's vehicle.</P>
<P></P>
<P>"Simulation training devices are one innovative way the OTC Center for Workforce Development is investing in order to better serve those in the fields of emergency medicine and law enforcement. Those driving skills are critical to their jobs," said Sherry Coker, director of the center.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The law enforcement software used on the simulator gives users a number of scenarios to deal with during a chase, including oncoming traffic and dangerous intersection crossings. Similar hazardous situations are presented to those using the ambulance software.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Sue Allan, an OTC Emergency Medical Technician instructor, said the emergency vehicle training can be used in conjunction with the new mobile ambulance that accurately reproduces the back of an ambulance. It includes a sophisticated medical manikin that students can practice providing care for, while hydraulics move the unit around as if it were driving down a street or highway.</P>
<P></P>
<P>"Defensive driving concepts are heightened when running with red lights. We can make sure EMTs are adhering to policies for driving emergency vehicles," said Doug Akers, manager of the OTC Transport Training Institute. </P>
<P></P>
<P>"This will help them react to conditions. Instead of learning it as it happens, they can come here and learn it safely. That's important."</P>

                    <P>OTC students Emily Kleier and Lindsay Freres experienced a bit of deja vu this semester when they enrolled in the colleges Early Childhood Education program.</P>
<P>Not many years ago, the two were cared for as young children at the Early Childhood Center. Today, they are there learning to care for young children themselves.</P>
<P>"I was getting a few flashbacks at first," said Kleier, who came to the center when she was 4 years old at its old location, a block south of the new facility.</P>
<P>For Freres, it was like coming back to her family.</P>
<P>"Being in class was a weird feeling at first. It's like family here. I like it here," she said.</P>
<P>But neither of them was too taken aback because they came around OTC a lot as kids; their relatives worked at OTC, and they were able to be enrolled in the daycare program.</P>
<P>"I remember playing on the playground here and the fall student picnics that I got to go to. We have pictures of that," said Freres, who volunteered at the Center when she was growing up.</P>
<P>Connie Harmon, the center's manager, knows the college has been open long enough that some who were there as small children are now returning as grownup students.</P>
<P>"It's really cool to know they started their education here at age 3 or 4 and now are coming back. Ill feel old when its one I've had as a child coming back for classes," she said.</P>
<P>Teachers that once took care of the two students are still there and now ready to lend a hand to the two students.</P>
<P>"Miss Melissa (Freres, Lindsay's mother) came into my classroom and showed me a picture of me in her class," said Kleier.</P>
<P>Kleier wants to be a first grade teacher as teaching runs in her family. Both of her sisters-in-law are teachers.</P>
<P>"I decided last year that's what I wanted to do. Ive always liked children. I get along with them pretty well," she said.</P>
<P>Harmon said she's proud that the education the two got as children at the center is working for them today.</P>
<P>"Its important that kids get a quality early start and the two of them are proof of that importance," she said.</P>

		<title>Early-morning class extends time of class offerings</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
                    
                    <p>Ozarks Technical Community College is very close to becoming a 24-hour college thanks to this fall&rsquo;s addition of a new Diesel Technology class that begins at 5 a.m.</p>
<p>Add that class to the successful late-night classes OTC has offered since last year, some which extend well past midnight, and the college has about 20 hours of classes almost every day.</p>
<p>The Electrical I class, which has a lecture component from 5-5:50 a.m. and lab from 6-6:50 a.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays, has 12 students enrolled.</p>
<p>The class teaches the students how to perform preventive maintenance and repair methods required of an entry-level technician in the automotive and diesel fields and is a required course in the Diesel Technology program.</p>
<p>The instructor, Jay Yinger, said the class was developed after talking with Layton Childress, dean of technical education.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many of these students work at night and when they get off work, they can come straight to class,&rdquo; Childress said.</p>
<p>Several of the students come in from a graveyard shift where they work and two come from Bolivar, Yinger said. Other students include those with a military background and those who have been home schooled.</p>
<p>And students appear to enjoy the class.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything is fine as long as I keep the coffee coming,&rdquo; Yinger said.</p>
<p>The class has been so successful that, at the request of the students, part two of the electrical class will be held at the same time in the spring semester.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The students said that they all wanted to come back and take the second class at the same time,&rdquo; Yinger said.</p>
<p>The early morning class pairs and the late-night classes are popular among some students.</p>
<p>Yinger said his class and the late-night classes offer students a choice in class times that&rsquo;s important in meeting their needs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The colleges are changing and becoming more flexible,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re trying to make it convenient for the working student and the parent student.&rdquo;</p>

                    <SPAN lang=EN>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Don't look now, but OTC's Electronic Media Production program is quickly becoming one of the best in the country, if the recent results at the national SkillsUSA Championships are any indication.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>For the second straight year, the EMP's broadcast news production and television video production teams earned gold medals as the best in the country among all others who came to Kansas City recently to compete. </P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>More than 6,000 career and technical education students (all state contest winners) competed in 99 different trade, technical and leadership fields, including those in the electronic media field. </P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"It's an amazing feeling," said Dana Price, one of the EMP instructors who participated. "We are very fortunate to receive such an honor."</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>The gold medal winners were: Broadcast News Production -Dylan Durrington, Kaitlyn Schumacher, Brandon Vanderstine and Nic Stogsdill; Television (Video) Production- Brandon Harper and Tyler Sederwall.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Durrington, a student from Springfield, said he was worried about how well he would do in the competition.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"I was a last-minute sub for someone as the floor director," he said." I was a little nervous. Everyone else was confident. I'm very, very excited."</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Jeff Johnson, another EMP instructor, said the wins show that the program taught at OTC is among the best, if not the best.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"One of the goals is to win at Skills," he said. "But the ultimate goal is to get them employed. It's great for the students and great for their resume."</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Johnson attended Hillcrest High School and was involved in the schools television program (HTV) that is a perennial national award winner and is often used as a model by other schools around the country.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>The Hillcrest program blossomed under its founder, Dave Davis, whom Johnson studied under in high school and who used as the model for his approach in the classroom.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"I came from a program that was always successful and the reason was because of Mr. Davis," Johnson said. "Having him was a plus."</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Davis said:" I love seeing former HTVers take their skills to the next level. Jeff is an example of that. He is so talented. OTC is lucky to have him."</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Johnson said the program and college are winners after the national competition.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"It lets everyone know we are preparing students the right way in EMP for the job market," he said. "That should draw more attention and more students to us."</P></SPAN>

<P dir=ltr align=left>When representatives from the Springfield chapter of Habitat for Humanity came to OTC looking for help in developing a video commercial, Taylor Patterson and Corbin Livingston jumped at the opportunity.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"I said to myself, 'I can whip something up,'" said Livingston, a student in the colleges Electronic Media Production program. Both are in the EMP capstone class on producing and directing video.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>The Habitat folks had gone to other outlets looking for help in creating some commercials to promote the organizations Tool Belts and Bow Ties fund-raiser coming up in the spring.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Everyone else said no. Patterson and Livingston said sure.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"Why wouldnt you want to help?" Patterson asked.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>The two students have worked together before on projects and had about a months worth of work in it. They have done commercial work for Facebook and You Tube. </P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>The pair worked on it at school and at Livingston's home. Livingston's fiance did the voice over narration on the video.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"It was a busy time. They came to us in October but we had enough time to turn it in to them in November," Livingston said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>The pair created a 90- and 30-second commercial that included voice over narration, video and photos. </P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"I think they turned out better than I expected," Livingston said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Habitat officials were tickled by the results.</P>
<P></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"We are so grateful for everyones help at OTC," said Brandi VanAntwerp, Development Director for local Habitat office.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"Their professionalism in producing the video, as well as creative ability went above and beyond our expectations. We are excited to share the video to promote our event through a format that has not been possible in our event's history."</P>
<P></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Both students are graduating. Livingston is starting a job at television station KRBK in January.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Patterson works three jobs and is trying to get her name out to pick up some freelance work.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Livingston said he would miss OTC after graduation.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"The program helped me network with people," he said.</P>

                    <P>There are plenty of movie plots based on someone breaking a sophisticated code of a government agency, and instead of prosecuting the culprit, the agency offers him or her a job.</P>
<P>That wasnt quite the case when it comes to Cory Benda, but it was close.</P>
<P>Benda, who works full-time as an information technology server systems administrator at OTC, came on board in the department after leaving a "hey, you should hire me" text file message in a file that only OTC network employees were supposed to have access to.</P>
<P>When Eric Freeman, director of network systems, saw the message, he realized Benda "was someone I wanted working for me in the future."</P>
<P>At the time, Benda was a student in OTCs pilot Middle College program, designed for students who struggle in traditional classroom settings. Students could only pick from two areas of study: early childhood education or diesel/automotive technology.</P>
<P>"Cory was one of the most exceptionally bright and talented students weve had in Middle College. He preferred a non-traditional setting. Middle College was an environment he could thrive in," said LaRaine Bauer, dean of special academic programs. </P>
<P>But diesel repair was not his forte´, so Bauer contacted network services and recommended they look at Benda. </P>
<P>"When I first met Cory, he was a student in the Middle College who was testing our computers and finding flaws. Over the course of the next five years, he started working for information technology fixing the flaws as a part-time employee and then later became a server systems administrator," Freeman said, who gave Benda part-time work and then moved him to full-time.</P>
<P>Bendas attraction to computers and system management comes from his paternal grandmother who was a binary and Cobalt programmer for NASA.</P>
<P>"She was really good at math. She challenged me every time I would visit her in the summer. She got me into computers," he said.</P>
<P>Now, in his position with OTC, Benda gets to work in an area he knows hes suited for.</P>
<P>"Working at OTC is a lot of fun. I get to work in the education area. The atmosphere is much nicer here. Its not about money; its about students," he said.</P><I>

                    <P>The darkened Room 211 in Lincoln Hall was filled with the screams of injured students, wounded in explosion set deliberately to hurt people.</P>
<P>Paramedics and EMTs from CoxHealth made their way through the destruction and mayhem to see who was severely injured and who could make it to a triage area set up nearby.</P>
<P>"Ok, ok," someone yells above the din. "Take a break."</P>
<P>The lights come on. Some of the "injured" students giggle. Others check their "wounds" to see if they need more makeup.</P>
<P>All were part of a day-long emergency simulation held last week at OTC to help Cox emergency personnel practice and prepare for the real thing  a deadly explosion in a school room.</P>
<P>The OTC simulation center made its elaborate facilities available to the Cox for the exercise.</P>
<P>"The Simulation Center at Ozarks Technical Community College feels it is important to provide continuing education to those involved in and serve our community," said director Michelle Howard. </P>
<P>"This includes our partnership with Cox Hospital.&nbsp; The mock mass casualty held at OTC involved both students and Cox pre-hospital personnel."</P>
<P>The "victims" were primarily OTC's high school health occupation students. They were given the opportunity to see trained paramedics and EMTs working together to provide care for injured patients on a large scale.&nbsp;</P>
<P>"The students saw first-hand the way these health care professionals collaborated together as a team using their leadership and effective communication skills with only a small amount of resources and in a very stressful environment."</P>
<P>Mike Gooch, an adjunct instructor with OTC and a member of the Cox training personnel, said the exercise was part of ongoing training program for CoxHealth personnel.</P>
<P>"We provide quarterly sessions for all of the CoxHealth Pre-Hospital paramedics and EMTs that are currently assigned and work on ambulances in any of the seven counties CoxHealth provides ambulance service," he said.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>"This simulation was used as part of the day-long training that included a lecture and a couple sessions of simulation.&nbsp;The simulation is used to give the realism of having patients to triage and sort the severity of injuries, to start working through the process of accounting for, treating and transporting the patients."</P>

                    <p>For a military veteran, transitioning from their former life to one that includes time spent on a college campus can be a challenge.</p>
<p>To help ease them into their new surroundings, Ozarks Technical Community College developed an English course designed especially for veterans. A section of English 101 was offered for the first time this spring for veterans in an effort to surround them with other students from the same military background.</p>
<p>Larry Rottmann, a Vietnam veteran who teaches the classes, said the dropout rate among returning veterans is more than 60 percent, and OTC wanted to do something about that for the nearly 500 veterans who attend classes at OTC.</p>
<p>The class Rottmann teaches is similar to one he taught at the University of Massachusetts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are readjustment issues for these guys and we are sympathetic to that situation. We are being more flexible and know that they need some time to get going in a class. There is a casual approach with serious intent. The course was not designed as a counseling class or to pander to their military experience,&rdquo; Rottmann said.</p>
<p>This semester, the students, who range in age from 23-53, have written on a number of topics, including who they would like to see as president to what five things would they would rescue from a fire.</p>
<p>There are six students in the class, which will be offered again in the fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The class helps ease you into the college atmosphere. I&rsquo;m just not into hanging out in class with kids just out of high school,&rdquo; said Steve Larson, who served in the U.S. Army from 1982-2004, which included a number of tours overseas.</p>
<p>David McCart of Springfield, a 16-year Army veteran with time spent in Iraq and Kosovo, said he tried to take a class at Missouri State University but ran into students who were picketing ROTC and &ldquo;that didn&rsquo;t go over too good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if this class helps emotionally, but it is definitely a better learning experience,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The surroundings are familiar with other vets in the class.&rdquo;</p>

		<title>Entertainer traces roots to OTC training</title>

                    <SPAN lang=EN>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Ben Blaques time at OTC was well spent and helped contribute to creating a death-defying act that he has taken to the East Coast.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Blaque, a Kickapoo graduate, took classes in auto refinishing, drafting as well as welding, before following the entertainment bug. </P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"I love to build things, make stuff for cars. I was also interested in performing since high school," Blaque said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>His passion eventually led him to a job with magician Kirby Van Burch in Branson where he worked on the stage crew. Van Buren also gave him some small parts on stage.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"I started out horrible. It was not like being in a high school play. People were paying to see this," he remembered.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Blaque would videotape his performances and critique them, looking for ways to make the act more thrilling and daring. He started incorporating a crossbow in the act, shooting balloons or the strings attached to the balloon. </P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"I was building props for Kirby and would try to build stuff but my welding skills were not good. It was a big roadblock," he said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>So Blaque called OTC welding program Jim&nbsp;Bridwell, lead instructor in the OTC Welding Technology program.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Bridwell agreed to drive to Branson and show Blaque some techniques.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"He picked it up pretty fast," Bridwell said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>After the lessons, Blaque said the welding began to flow.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Then came Blaque big break. He won a spot on the Americas Got Talent television show. </SPAN><A href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-4JL03z0zE"><SPAN lang=EN>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-4JL03z0zE</SPAN></A></P><SPAN lang=EN>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>While he didn't win, he's had plenty of new offers and is now in the process of opening a theater of his own in Myrtle Beach, S.C.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>And there, he hopes to debut his most dangerous act, for which he built the props.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>It involves him hanging upside down and it the path of a pair of giant jaws held apart by a burning rope. Across the room is a key that unlocks the shackles that hold Blaque's ankles in place. He must get the key and get out before the rope burns through and releases the steel jaws.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"Think Venus flytrap," he said with a smile.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Blaque recently returned to OTC to talk to welding students about his time at the college.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"OTC helped me create a world of what I wanted to be in life. Those classes I took helped me design and build my own props. Without that, I would never have been able to afford to do this," he said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left><EM></EM></P></SPAN>

		<title>Facilities employee makes mark at Highland games</title>

                    <SPAN lang=EN>
<P dir=ltr align=left>When one talks about a big man on campus, that honor could certainly go to OTC's Robert Dale, a facilities employee on the Springfield campus for the past five years.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>When Dale attended Ava High School, he was just a 150-pounder who didn't play sports. Today, Dale is an imposing figure at a muscular 275 pounds, the former power lifter is taking his strength talents to a new area Highland games, competition that stretches back to the days that were captured in the movie "Braveheart."</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"I wanted to stay in the strength games and not stay as sore as long as I did after a lifting competition," said Dale. </P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>So, Dale picked the traditional Scottish competition to use his strength.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>I'm only sore for a couple of days instead of a week," he said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>The games are events held throughout the year in the Scotland Highlands. The standard games include:</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>The caber toss: The competition involves the use of a long tapered pine pole or log that's stood upright and hoisted by the competitor who balances it vertically holding one end in his hands. Then the competitor runs and tosses it so that it turns end over end with the upper end striking the ground first.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>The stone put: Similar to the modern-day shot put as seen in the Olympic Games, in this version a large stone of variable weight is often used. </P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Weight over the bar. The athletes attempt to toss a 56-pound weight with an attached handle over a horizontal bar using only one hand. </P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Dale has been competing for a year in the Masters level for those over 45 years old and has competed in six games. </P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"One of the advantages to Highland games over lifting is that you can train by yourself in the games competition. In lifting, you need someone to spot for you in case you cant handle the weight," he said. </P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>One of Dale's best events is the weight over bar. He's thrown the weight over a bar 17 feet high. He's also excelled in the sheaf toss that requires him to take a 20-pound sheaf of straw jammed in a burlap sack and toss it vertically with a pitchfork over a raised bar.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Dale has gotten very involved in the sport and is now organizing his own games in Springfield, one of which was held last weekend.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"This sport has been around longer than any other except wrestling. We have participants who are 71 years old. Two are over 50," Dale said. "It's great. It gets you off the couch and away from the TV."</P>

                    <p>By Steve Koehler</p>
<p>The loved ones of soldiers who are killed while serving in Iraq or Afghanistan will not have to give up their educational future thanks to a new partnership between the OTC Foundation, the Community Foundation of the Ozarks and the Musgrave Foundation.</p>
<p>The organizations are joining together to create the Fallen Soldiers Scholarship, a program that will provide tuition, fees and books to OTC for spouses and dependents of military service members killed while serving on active duty in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a tremendous opportunity for families,&rdquo; Adjutant General<em> </em>Steve Danner of the Missouri National Guard told the audience at a press conference at OTC Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are many stay-at-home spouses, and this makes what we can do for those families that much more important. I feel good about the program because my family is my bedrock. There&rsquo;s nothing more important in the world than to see your children educated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The program will launch in January 2010. Ozarks Technical Community College will manage and administer the scholarship program.</p>
<p>Since 9/11, a total of 108 Missouri soldiers have been killed while serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, many leaving behind families.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;This will help make the lives of veterans&rsquo; families better,&rdquo; said Dr. Hal Higdon, president of OTC. &ldquo;Families have limited funds because of the loss of a loved one who served. These private dollars will help those families.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eligible spouses and dependents must be residents of the OTC Service Area, which includes : Christian, Dallas, Douglas, Greene, Laclede, Ozark, Polk, Pulaski, Stone, Taney, Webster and Wright.</p>
<p>Beau Cruse, who was injured while on active duty in Iraq, now attends OTC and said it would be comforting to know that a military family would be taken care of if their loved one died.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one less thing to worry about. The cost of education goes up. It&rsquo;s about respect. If I gave my life over there, then I would know OTC would be giving something back,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Funding will come from the Community Foundation of the Ozarks and, the Musgrave Foundation and, based on the funds available, the OTC Foundation. The OTC Foundation will manage the scholarship program. Currently, the OTC Foundation does not have funds designated to support this initiative.</p>
<p>For more information, contact the OTC Foundation at foundation@otc.edu or call Stephanie Brown at (417) 447-2653. A video about the program can be seen on www.otc.edu.</p>

		<title>Family has ties to OTC, Lincoln High School</title>

                    <p>Until this summer, Tanisha Rainey could only imagine her grandmother, Henrietta Rainey, attending Lincoln High School, which is now Lincoln Hall on the OTC Springfield campus.</p>
<p>But now, the first-year OTC student can do more than just dream of her grandmother in Lincoln. Now, she can see her Henrietta&rsquo;s image any time she wants in a picture taken during the early 1950s that hangs on a wall inside the very building her grandmother attended high school.</p>
<p>The picture shows Henrietta Rainey sitting in a sewing class held at the all-black high school. The picture is part of a display of photos and artifacts from the historic high school that hang in the hall&rsquo;s largest meeting room.</p>
<p>And until that moment this summer, Tanisha had never seen a picture of her grandmother or even knew it existed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud to know family who used to go to school here,&rdquo; Tanisha said.</p>
<p>Tanisha, a senior at Central High School who attends OTC classes through the Career Center, is studying Early Childhood Development. She made the photo discovery during student orientation this summer after an OTC staff member told her that there was a picture of her grandmother on the wall.</p>
<p>It was a startling discovery for Tanisha and her aunt, Jeanetta Rainey Smith, the daughter of Henrietta Rainey. Jeanetta Smith&rsquo;s aunt, Molly, also went to Lincoln but she doesn&rsquo;t appear in any pictures. Both women are dead, Smith said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I saw the picture, I said, &lsquo;Oh, my God, there she is,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Smith, who took classes on the third floor of Lincoln when it was part of the vocational school in the late 1970s prior to the creation of OTC.</p>
<p>Black students in Springfield attended Lincoln High School from 1884 until 1954. In 1954, the public schools in Springfield were integrated and Lincoln was closed.</p>
<p>The building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in May 2000. Renovation of historic Lincoln Hall by OTC was completed in 2001. A plaque recognizing the building's placement on the National Register was unveiled in August 2004.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Smith thought the school building had been leveled years ago and when she came to campus last week to see the photo again, she said she feels like her mother is still there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awesome to know that you have pictures of people on the wall and their children and children&rsquo;s children are walking these halls. It&rsquo;s an honor that someone would take the time to do this and make this display,&rdquo; Smith said, who was overcome with emotion while talking about the photo display.</p>
<p>Smith took up sewing thanks to her mother and Tanisha said she is learning a lot from her aunt, Jeanetta.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been living with her for a while and she has taught me a lot. I wouldn&rsquo;t have finished school without her or gone to OTC,&rdquo; she said.</p>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Even in the depths of the current economy downturn, there is money available for those who want to attend Ozarks Technical Community College.</p>
<p>The funding comes in the form of federal and state aid along with special moneys that can be directed to the non-traditional student who may not have the funds to attend school.</p>
<p>In addition to scholarships and grants, there are work-study programs through which students can work at OTC and earn money for school.</p>
<p>Anyone who want to take a credit class and seek grant or scholarship money must complete the federally mandated Free Application for Federal Student Aid or FASPA application.</p>
<p>The application can be found at www.fasfa.ed.gov. OTC officials warn that there is a community site with a similar Web address that charges a fee to fill out the form. OTC also offers help in completing the form.</p>
<p><strong>Scholarships for Non-Traditional Students</strong></p>

<p>&bull; Continuing Student Scholarship: Student must have a cumulative minimum 2.5 grade point average in OTC coursework, and must have completed a minimum of twenty-four (24) credit hours at OTC. Student must submit an essay explaining, &ldquo;How OTC has helped them achieve their goals?&rdquo;. Scholarship is good for two semesters (Fall/Spring only).

Application deadline is June 1 for Fall semester.</p>
<p><strong>Missouri Career Center programs</strong></p>
<p>The Workforce Investment Act (WIA) provides several of the programs at the Missouri Career Center including the Adult Services Program, the Dislocated Worker Program and the Youth Services program.</p>
<p>&bull; Dislocated Worker: Serves people who have lost their job through no fault of their own (layoffs, closures, business failure, etc.) Case managers work with these folks to provide career guidance, skills enhancement, job search assistance, and occupational training where appropriate. Tuition assistance is sometimes provided on a case by case basis.</p>
<ul>

		<title>Fine Arts Gallery to host Art Walk exhibit</title>

                    <p>Few people are more excited about the upcoming First Friday Art Walk than Kat Allie because of the attention it will bring to the OTC Fine Arts department and gallery housed on the third floor of the Gillioz Theater.</p>
<p>Allie is the fine arts instructor and manager of the college&rsquo;s Fine Arts Gallery, which will be home of the 10-year anniversary art contest and exhibition of Art Walk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked to be host of the event. We are a community college. We are very supportive of the community and the arts,&rdquo; said Allie, who has been with OTC since 2006.</p>
<p>Art Walk is celebrating the 10-year anniversary with an art contest and exhibit at the gallery. The juried contest will award cash prizes along with a People&rsquo;s Choice Award chosen by visitors to the winning artworks.</p>
<p>A large crowd is expected to walk through the OTC Gallery Friday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have gotten a lot of people who come up who are really surprised. They are discovering us for the first time during Art Walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The college moved its fine arts program to the Gillioz in the fall of 2007, and Allie, who studied photography and painting at Pittsburg State University and earned her master's from there, helped Cathy Clemens, Division Chair of Humanities and Fine Arts, establish studio art classes at OTC.</p>
<p>She produces works of art with a painting style called encaustic that involves the use of a special heated medium to create her works of art with propane torches and heat guns</p>
<p>Her work has been displayed at the Springfield-Branson National Airport, OTC and at Obelisk Home furnishings gallery. She conducts workshops throughout the area.</p>
<p>Allie is proud of how far the OTC Fine Arts Department has come since moving to the Gillioz.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awesome to be a part of the program here. It&rsquo;s meant everything to come here. We are officially a fine arts department. It&rsquo;s been really, really exciting. We&rsquo;ve been so busy, it&rsquo;s hard to take time to reflect,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>And Friday night could be Allie&rsquo;s busiest night ever.</p>

                    <P>As the spring semester rushes to a close, the OTC Fine Arts department is offering a pair of public performances to add to the calendar.</P>
<P>On Tuesday, the OTC Choirs will present "American Songs:&nbsp;A Tribute to Our Nation's Composers" at 7 p.m. at the Springfield Art Museum.</P>
<P>"Concert goers can expect to hear everything from traditional American melodies and hymn tunes to familiar pop and musical theater pieces.&nbsp;Our goal is to present modern American choral music in a seamless storyline," said Kathryn Cole, the choirs' director.</P>
<P>The college's Concert Choir and Chamber Singers as well as guest artists "NoteaBellas," will perform at the free event.</P>
<P>"This is our second concert at the Springfield Art Museum.&nbsp;The auditorium is a perfect space for our concerts.&nbsp;The venue gives our concert patrons the opportunity to hear our performances and enjoy all the museum has to offer," Cole said. &nbsp;"It's a beautiful space."</P>
<P>A week later, on May 9-11, the college's theater department will present "Laramie Project: Ten Years Later," a docu-drama that deals with the reaction to the 1998 murder of University of Wyoming gay student Matthew Shepard in Laramie, Wyo. The murder was denounced as a hate crime and brought attention to the lack of hate crime laws in Wyoming and other states.</P>
<P>"We chose 'The Laramie Project' first and foremost because we wanted a serious play that had something important to say, something that would challenge our students and our audiences and stimulate civic dialogue," said Jon Herbert, OTC theater, the play's production manager. </P>
<P>"The student-actors are being challenged in some very significant ways. The dozens of characters in the play are being played by only eight actors--all playing multiple roles of real people who are very different from themselves."</P>
<P>The play is being presented in Lincoln Hall, room 211, on Friday and Saturday at 7:30 p.m. and Sunday at 2:30 p.m. </P>
<P>"We are using Lincoln Hall room 211 as a make-shift black box theatre for the first time, so we wanted something that would fit into that space," Herbert said.</P>
<P>The performances are free and open to the public. Seating is limited. For reservations, call the OTC Fine Arts Department at 417-447-8975 for reservations, or email <A href="mailto:finearts@otc.edu"><U>finearts@otc.edu</U></A>.&nbsp;</P>

                    <p>Kat Allie had no idea people would be so enthused when she unveiled her community wishing wall project recently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought visually it would be cool but it was something the way each person has interacted with the piece and the wishes they put down,&rdquo; said the OTC Fine Arts instructor.</p>
<p>Allie said she got the idea for the project while in a restaurant in Gulfport, Miss.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the coolest thing I&rsquo;ve ever seen. But the one in the restaurant didn&rsquo;t create an image. The wishes were tacked to the wall,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The wall that Allie developed is a large painting of Vincent Van Gogh&rsquo;s famous &ldquo;Starry Night.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The painting in on a large piece of cardboard perforated with holes. People write their wish on a piece of colored paper that matches the color of the painting and insert it into the small opening.</p>
<p>There are 12,000 holes in the painting. After the wall made the rounds at OTC&rsquo;s Community Day and the recent ArtsFest, about 1,500 holes had been filled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I decided on &lsquo;Starry Night&rsquo; as the painting to showcase since it was appropriate with the wishing theme. I presented the idea to my 3D art class. They thought it was a great idea. I wanted to do a famous painting to tie in a bit with art history,&rdquo; said Allie, who is also manager of the OTC Fine Arts Gallery in the Gillioz Theater.</p>
<p>Allie plans to circulate the wall at community events and when it is filled, she will seal the wall and display it at the gallery. She estimates it will take about a year to fill all the holes.</p>
<p>What has amazed Allie the most is what people were asking for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had no idea what they were going to put down for wishes,&rdquo; Allie said.</p>
<p>A 4-year-old girl asked for a unicorn. A 10-year-old girl wrote something down that brought tears to her mother&rsquo;s eyes. An 8-year-old boy asked that he never have different parents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were asking for money, health, a job, world peace, pets and candy,&rdquo; Allie said. &ldquo;They took it real serious.&rdquo;</p>

		<title>Fire science alum giving back to OTC students</title>

                    <p>Bryan Newberry will never stop being a fire science student.</p>
<p>After earning an associate&rsquo;s degree from OTC in fire science technology in 2003, the 36-year-old Newberry eventually became fire chief of the city of Battlefield and is also an adjunct instructor at OTC in the same fire science program he went through.</p>
<p>Both jobs require him to stay on top of the latest innovations and technological advances in fighting fires. He passes that knowledge on to the firefighters under his watch and the students in his class.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really enjoy the college atmosphere. It&rsquo;s one of those fields where you have to keep up with the technology and grow if you&rsquo;re going to have the knowledge to keep teaching. I learn something new every day in the class as a teacher,&rdquo; Newberry said.</p>
<p>The 36-year-old&rsquo;s decision to become a firefighter was influenced by his grandfather, who was a firefighter on the Springfield Fire Department after serving as a Marine in World War II.</p>
<p>The Nixa High School graduate worked at the Nixa Fire Department starting in 1999 while going to OTC. He had been a volunteer there since he was 16. He became an assistant fire chief at Nixa before moving on to Battlefield where he oversees four firehouses and 30 employees.</p>
<p>His adjunct work started in 2005; he feels a duty to teach students everything he knows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;In fire service, with all the experience, education and knowledge you gain over the years, you feel obligated to give it back. If you don&rsquo;t share it, students lose a chance to get those skills,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Recently, the college received a fire engine thanks to a donation from Jon&rsquo;s Mid-America Fire Apparatus. The truck will be on display at OTC&rsquo;s Community Day April 28.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are so many benefits to having the fire engine. Students need to have the experience of how a fire truck works before their first day on the job,&rdquo; Newberry said. &ldquo;Now, they get that hands-on experience before stepping into a firehouse for the first time.&rdquo;</p>

                    <P>OTC's fire science program is working to bring its students so close to firefighting training that they can see it and touch it.</P>
<P>The program is gradually migrating its classes to the Springfield Fire Departments Engine House No. 6 of West Battlefield Road where the city's Regional Training Center is also located.</P>
<P>Former Springfield fire chief Dan Whisler, who now heads up the fire science program at OTC, has dreamed of bringing the students together with the professionals in a real-life setting.</P>
<P>"The working fire station is right there for students to be involved in the facility. There's the ability to have more interaction than we have now with some of the classes held on campus," Whisler said.</P>
<P>There are several classrooms at the facility that are being used now for OTC classes and over the next several semesters, more classes will migrate to the facility.</P>
<P>In addition, the program will be able to make use of the extensive state-of-the-art training facility that is located in the same building as the classrooms.</P>
<P>"They can learn practical skills, everything from putting up ladders to working on a training tower to practicing how to react in a flash over of fire overhead," Whisler said.</P>
<P>"We can do those sorts of things on campus like alive burn because of the smoke it produces."</P>
<P>The training facility also houses a large area where various types of rooms are replicated that allow firefights and students to go through to practice rescues and searches in dense smoke. They can practice going through different types of windows and even rappel in from a hatch in the room's ceiling.</P>
<P>Currently, the students are using an old house in Battlefield in cooperation with that town's fire department for training purposes.</P>
<P>"Eventually, we will be able to go from the classroom right into the training center and put the skills we talk about in the classroom into practical use right away," Whisler said.</P>
<P>Jin Trent, chief of the Nixa Fire Department, thinks moving the OTC program to the Springfield station is something that's needed.</P>
<P>"It needed to be done. They can have some hands-on training. Some of the students have never been in a fire department. The kids can see what all this work is about and see what it really is," Trent said.</P><I>

                    <p>By Steve Koehler</p>
<p>OTC&rsquo;s first-ever Academic Integrity Week begins Monday with five days of free events and discussions that are open to students, employees and the public.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This week has been planned to promote the college&rsquo;s core value of integrity and to draw awareness to the idea that a col&shy;lege should be a showcase of honest effort and personal growth, with the highest of personal and professional standards,&rdquo; said Michael Madden, dean of learning resources.</p>
<p>The schedule includes:</p>

<p>&bull; Wednesday: Noon, Lincoln 211. A panel discussion will be held with Springfield employers and human resources professionals to discuss the qualities and concerns that are important to them when reviewing applications and hiring new employees.</p>
<p>&bull; Thursday: 10:30 a.m., The Writing Center, Information Commons 200. A student workshop on avoiding plagiarism. The director of the OTC Writing Center, and the electronic services librarian, will offer students information on understanding and overcoming unintentional plagiarism. &nbsp;</p>

		<title>First Honors Program established at OTC</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
                    
                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>One of the clearest signs that Ozarks Technical Community College is evolving into an institution for serious study is the recent establishment of an honors program.</p>
<p>The program, which will be implemented with the fall 2009 semester, provides academically exceptional students an opportunity to develop their full potential through an enhanced learning environment of a designated community of scholars. The introductory seminar course to the honors program, HON 101, is offered currently as a pilot course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We challenge the students in smaller, seminar-based classes, where discussion and dialogue are encouraged. The approach to their learning is one in which we hope to encourage them or give them permission to learn outside of a textbook,&rdquo; said Caron Daugherty, director of the honors program. &ldquo;We do not want them to memorize material for an exam only to have them forget it in the next semester.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In order to be eligible for the program, new students must fulfill one of the following requirements: score a 27 on their ACT, attain a 3.75 high school GPA, or score a 3200 on the GED test. They can also qualify by earning a 95 in reading and a 98 in writing on their OTC entrance COMPASS efficiency tests.</p>
<p>Currently enrolled students need a 3.5 GPA after completing 12 or more credits.</p>
<p>Students in the pilot course are studying the paradox of affluence, the national topic of the Phi Theta Kappa honors programs. The students are studying how the topic relates in a number of areas, including the economy, the sciences, education and the arts.</p>
<p>Students also are reading Thomas Friedman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hot, Flat, and Crowded: Why We Need a Green Revolution - And How it Can Renew America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through the semester, students will hold discussions, do research and conduct interviews and surveys with selected groups about the affluence issue. Students make presentations at the end of the semester regarding their research topic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The design of the course is to challenge the students and involve them in their own learning process. Through discussion, dialogue, research, presentation, and communication, we hope to advance the course beyond a lecture and note-taking class,'' Daugherty said.</p>
<p>OTC has an articulation agreement with Missouri State University that will allow honors students from OTC to transfer into the honors college at MSU.</p>
<p>The seven students who make up the first OTC honors class said they have found the course to be a springboard to express themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was expecting a free exchange of ideas and people who care about academic achievement. That&rsquo;s exactly what I&rsquo;ve found,&rdquo; said Christina Hahn, a second-year student from Clever.</p>
<p>Jordana McReynolds of Springfield said the class breaks the mold of typical college classes that require &ldquo;memorization and regurgitation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can explore issues on a real level. Everything we do here is applicable to real life,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Daugherty said in the fall, there will be two honors sections offered with about 15 spots in each class, but added that her first class will be a special one for her personally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t have asked for a better group to start with. I&rsquo;m learning so much through them,&rdquo; she said.</p>

		<title>First nurses' ceremony pinning held at Reeds Spring</title>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The first pinning ceremony of practical nurses graduating from Ozarks Technical Community College&rsquo;s Reeds Spring facility proves that the demand for nurses remains steady and strong.</p>
<p>There are 35 in the College&rsquo;s first class to earn their pins since OTC took over the Reeds Spring program last summer. The ceremony will be June 18 at 6:30 p.m. at Reeds Spring Middle School auditorium.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s as large a demand here for nursing as anywhere, especially with Skaggs Hospital here,&rdquo; said Sheila Kaylor, the practical nursing program coordinator for OTC. She said the program located in Stone County is in great demand, drawing students from Blue Eye, Hartville, Fordland and Monett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It gives students an opportunity to get into the program here although there are only so many seats available,&rdquo; Kaylor said.</p>
<p>After graduating, the nurses will eligible to take the test to become a licensed practical nurse, Kaylor said.</p>
<p>The takeover by OTC of the program previously operated by the Reeds Spring school district has been a win-win for everyone, Kaylor said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s be an overall benefit for the student in that they can earn college credit now. When they become LPNs, their salary will increase 50 percent depending on where they go to work,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Theresa Inman of Aurora looks forward to spending time with her children for a while and Danielle Osborne of Fordland plans to continue her education and get work toward four-year nursing degree.</p>
<p>Inman, 34, said she worked, went to school and raised her family as a single mother and it was worth it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This pinning means I&rsquo;ve done something I set out to do 18 years ago,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Osborne will have a large rooting section at the ceremony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a huge accomplishment for me,&rdquo; said Osborne, 34, a first-generation college student, who has a husband and two children. &ldquo;I planned to go to nursing school after raising a family. I wanted to be a good example for the kids. They will all be cheering for me.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>A steady stream of students from Ozarks Technical Community College took advantage of the College&rsquo;s first Transfer Day Thursday and considered their options in continuing their education future at the four-year institution.</p>
<p>The fair, sponsored by the College&rsquo;s Enrollment Management office, allowed students to meet with representatives from 27 colleges and universities from Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas and Oklahoma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a lot of good information here,&rdquo; said Sterling Kromas of Marionville, who has his associate of arts degree from OTC and is looking at various medical fields for future study.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was a good event to have. It had information I didn&rsquo;t have already. It helped me narrow my choices down to two schools.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Vicki MacDonald, director of enrollment and recruitment at the College, said the idea for the fair was to expand the transfer desks already on campus for Missouri State and Drury universities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not have all the reps here. More and more students are coming to OTC because of the costs and are transferring to four-year colleges. The students want to be knowledgeable about where they can go,&rdquo; MacDonald said, who added that the fair would become an annual event.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to start a tradition,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Kim Houston, coordinator of transfer admission for the University of Missouri-Columbia, said about 40 percent of the transfers there are coming from the community college ranks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are looking to the future for sources of students. High school graduation rates are expected to go down so we are looking to the community colleges for enrollment,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This fair is good because it prepares them for the next step.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Caitlin Westkamp of Nixa, a second-year OTC student from Nixa, staled with Houston about enrollment possibilities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting ready to pick a school. I&rsquo;ve switched from teaching to nursing and am looking for a school to go to. MU is one I&rsquo;m exploring,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Jim Snyder, outreach coordinator for Pittsburg State University School of Technology, said the programs offered at OTC are compatible with the four-year degrees offered at Pittsburg State.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OTC has good accreditation. We&rsquo;re checked their credentials,&rdquo; Snyder said. &ldquo;This is a good way for students who don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s what out there. For us, it&rsquo;s a perfect fit. It&rsquo;s like a glove.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>Going to college for the first time can be a bit intimidating. Being the first in your family to attend can be even more daunting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why there is plenty of support for the 4,100 first-generation college students at Ozarks Technical Community College this fall to help them make the experience as comfortable as possible.</p>
<p>The First-Generation College Student group offers students a chance to meet together and talk about issues. They also hear from peers and others about what to expect at college.</p>
<p>There is an online discussion board for first-generation students to talk about issues or have questions answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are a lot of challenges and barriers for first-generation students,&rdquo; said Kathy Christy, the group&rsquo;s advisor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are relationship issues where some families don&rsquo;t think the student should be going to college. There&rsquo;s time management issues and some are in need of remedial assistance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amanda Roberts, a student from Branson West, said her family has been supportive of her attending college.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they can&rsquo;t help me with my homework,&rdquo; Roberts said, adding that she has looked into the first-generation club and what it offers. She has gotten support from a number of sources.</p>
<p>Dawn Wood of Springfield is a first-generation student who has gone to her instructors for help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been really great. It has been weird coming back to school after so many years away,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The first-generation group serves as an advocate for students like Roberts and Woods, Christy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to enhance their college experience and talk to them about networking possibilities,&rdquo; said Christy, a former first-generation student herself.</p>

<P dir=ltr align=left>Rob Dixon didn't know what to expect when he walked into a classroom for the first time this semester to teach an introduction to American government and politics class at OTC.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>The executive vice president of the Springfield Area Chamber of Commerce was a new part-time instructor at OTC and knew the subject was something he loved and knew a lot about. He wasn't too sure how his students would react. Midway through the semester, he couldn't be happier.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"Teaching and working with students is a new experience for me. It has been much more rewarding than I though it would be," he said. </P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"None of them is a political science major but they are taking what they learn in class beyond the classroom. One student asked me about to he could get involved in a political party."</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>OTC is looking for more instructors like Dixon who have career and academic experience to come to work at the College.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"At OTC, we value instructors who have training and practical experience," said Tim Baltes, OTC college director of human resources. "Instructors who bring academic knowledge and work experience into the classroom can enhance student learning."</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>The College will conduct its first Adjunct Faculty Career Fair March 22 from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. at the OTC Springfield Campus.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>The College is recruiting general education and technical instructors to teach part-time at all five of its locations in Springfield, Richwood Valley, Lebanon, Waynesville and Table Rock beginning in summer 2014.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Dixon said when he heard that the College needed, he said he jumped at the chance.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"I do a lot of speaking and presenting in my job. I wanted to teach on a subject that I know a lot about," he said. "OTC has a great support system of adjuncts. The administration wants to help and you are not left alone."</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Adjunct instructors start at $707 to per credit hour and over time can earn as much as $960 per credit hour. </P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Interested candidates should bring a completed </SPAN><SPAN lang="">OTC application at </SPAN><A href="http://www.otc.edu/Documents_Human_Resources/ApplicationforEmployment.pdf"><SPAN lang="">http://www.otc.edu/Documents_Human_Resources/ApplicationforEmployment.pdf</SPAN></A><SPAN lang="">, bring a resume, unofficial undergraduate and graduate transcripts, and any certifications or licenses appropriate for the position to the career fair.</P>
<P></SPAN><SPAN lang=EN></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>

                    <P>Physical education meets physical therapy every week at Ozarks Technical Community College.</P>
<P>The College's physical therapist assistant program has added a fitness component to its curriculum to focus on self-fitness for future PTA graduates.</P>
<P>"The philosophy of the PTA program addresses the role of health and wellness in society. One of our program goals is that faculty and students will promote health and wellness within the community," said Becky Crocker, PTA program director.</P>
<P>"As a faculty, we determined that a focus on self-fitness should start in the classroom from the beginning of the program."</P>
<P>All 24 students take part in three one-hour fitness segments every week: yoga or Zumba, walking trails at the OTC Richwood Valley campus or at other community parks and circuit training at the OC Fitness Center in Ozark.</P>
<P>Dr. Steven Bishop, provost and vice chancellor of academic affairs, leads the yoga classes himself in the FEMA shelter at OTC Richwood Valley.</P>
<P>"The fitness program offers stress relief strategies and hopefully, the development of life-long wellness behaviors," Crocker said.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Students have enjoyed the workouts as part of their curriculum even if they didnt know they were unaware of it at first.</P>
<P>"I didnt know that this was going to be part of the class. It was a nice surprise," said Leigh Anne Hudgings of Ash Grove.</P>
<P>"I typically worked out 5-6 days a week. I thought that with school, workouts might fall by the wayside. But they havent."</P>
<P>Hudgings said the training will help her with patients when she goes to work.</P>
<P>"We are going to have to show clients how to perform certain exercises as part of their therapy and we will be able to show them the right way to do them since we are doing them ourselves," she said.</P>
<P>Amanda McKiernan of Willard said she didn't know about the classes, either.</P>
<P>"I work out three times a week and this is a good surprise," she said, adding that she needs to build up strength to work with some patients.</P>
<P>"I'm a smaller person and I have to be able to catch people when they are doing their work sometimes. I need to build up my strength so I can have more control," she said.</P><I>
<P> </P></I>

		<title>Follow steps for financial aid at OTC</title>

                    <p>A recent article in the Community College Times suggested that community colleges should do more about getting the word out to students about financial aid that&rsquo;s available.</p>
<p>Jeff Ford, director of financial aid at Ozarks Technical Community College, said more than $20 million in Pell grants was distributed to more than 7,000 students during the past year and the total amount of all financial aid topped $36 million.</p>
<p>About 40 percent of the 13,000 students who attended OTC this past year did not use financial aid, Ford said, mostly because students either didn&rsquo;t apply or qualify for aid, took just one or two classes that they paid for themselves or attended classes that were paid with tuition waivers or by their employer.</p>
<p>Ford added that there are those who aren&rsquo;t aware of what financial aid is available. His advice to those students is simple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do the FAFSA,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>FAFSA stands for the Free Application for Financial Student Aid. It is the document every student must complete in order to determine how much financial aid they can receive. No FAFSA, no financial aid. The form, which has been simplified, is available only at www. FAFSA.gov.</p>
<p>There are deadlines for when the FAFSA has to be complete. In order receive aid at the start of the fall semester, the completed FAFSA and related forms, including the admission application found online, must be submitted to the OTC Financial Aid office by July 1.</p>
<p>Those FAFSAs completed after July 1 will be processed, but the financial aid may not be available until later in the fall semester.</p>
<p>Ford said it&rsquo;s not surprising that some students aren&rsquo;t aware of how to apply for aid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are students and parents who are having their first brush with college. They have no idea what&rsquo;s out there. They are eligible for aid and don&rsquo;t know it,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>New students who come to OTC are advised several times through the enrollment process about completing a FAFSA form. There are handouts and orientation meetings designed to tell students about applying for financial aid.</p>
<p>First-time students can find the admission application and more information at http://www.otc.edu/First-time-students.php</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Brett Ellis got his first taste of computer programming and animation while attending Ozarks Technical Community College in 2000.</span></p>
<p><span>Today, Ellis has taken what he learned at the College and become a top special effects artist for a visual effects studio, Digital Domain, in Los Angeles.</span></p>
<p><span>The Hartville native has worked on such movies as &ldquo;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,&rdquo; &ldquo;The A-Team,&rdquo; &ldquo;2012&rdquo; and &ldquo;Transformers 3.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Growing up in the small town about 50 miles east of Springfield, Ellis was drawn to video games, and after graduation, he came to OTC to earn his Associate of Arts degree before transferring to the Savannah College of Art &amp; Design.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Taking those classes as OTC helped me decide that pursuing animation/visual effects was something that I would definitely like to try. I do still have those programming basics I learned at OTC that I dust off from time to time,&rdquo; Ellis said in an email interview from Vancouver, B.C., where he is working on a yet-to-be-announced film.</span></p>
<p><span>As a special effects artist, Ellis and others tweak films with specialized animation of characters and vehicles. It can mean adding or enhancing smoke, weather, destruction elements, fire, roaring seas or steaming lava to a film.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;It can be very intense work. One week, I worked 99 hours. My advice is if you are thinking about going into that industry, you need to make sure you really love doing the work or you won&rsquo;t last,&rdquo; he said.</span></p>
<p><span>Ellis doesn&rsquo;t go on the set while the movie is made, so he hasn&rsquo;t had any brushes with major movie stars. He has, however, bumped into some when he was working out regularly at a gym in Venice Beach. He&rsquo;s rubbed elbows there with the likes of Hulk Hogan, The Roc and heavyweight boxer Wladimir Klitschko.</span></p>
<p><span>Ellis&rsquo; career has taken him to many countries to work on films, including Australia, which remains one of his favorite countries.</span></p>
<p><span>Surprisingly, Ellis&rsquo; favorite films don&rsquo;t include a lot of visual effects, if any.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a huge western fan. I love Clint Eastwood films and the James Bond films &mdash;&nbsp;the Sean Connery era, of course,&rdquo; he said.</span></p>

		<title>Former OTC student fulfills dream after internship</title>

                    <P>The five OTC campuses and centers will be alive today with thousands of students who will be working toward fulfilling their educational goals.</P>
<P>One former OTC student has already seen his dream come true is Brandon Davis, now the owner of French Davis Collision in Nixa.</P>
<P>A dozen years ago, Davis was taking automotive collision classes in the college's Dual Credit program as a student from Parkview High School.</P>
<P>"I wanted to learn to fix cars that I tore up as a kid," he said. </P>
<P>As a student in the program, Davis was offered an internship with a local auto body collision company. That's where he met Gary French.</P>
<P>"I was an intern for a week and then he hired me the day after I graduated," Davis said, who completed his studies in 2002.</P>
<P>Davis had a scholarship to study engineering at the Missouri University of Science and Technology but decided repairing cars was his passion.</P>
<P>How did his parents react to turning down the scholarship?</P>
<P>"I fix their cars for them today," he said with a smile. "I didn't want to sit behind a desk."</P>
<P>After a bit of a rocky start at his full-time job, the relationship between Davis and French got stronger and when Davis told his boss he wanted to open his own business, Davis suggested he go with him on the new venture.</P>
<P>In 2010, they two opened the current business. Last August, French decided to retire and sold his interest to Davis. </P>
<P>Davis has no regrets about following his dream.</P>
<P>"It's important to do what you enjoy. If you're good at something, the money will follow," he said.</P>
<P>Because of the top-notched auto collision program at OTC, Davis looks to the college for potential employees.</P>
<P>His top painter, Jesse Webb, is an OTC graduate and Davis said all nine of his full-time employees have some connection with the OTC automotive program.</P>
<P>Davis, who just turned 30, credits the OTC program for sending him on his way to fulfilling his dream of owning his own shop.</P>
<P>"It played a big part in where I am today," he said. "If I hadn't taken the classes and gotten the internship, I wouldn't have gotten my foot in the door. I wouldn't be working on cars."</P><I>

                    <SPAN lang=EN>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Gillian Moore lets her painting speak for her.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>The former OTC student needs to since she was born with a speech impediment 23 years ago.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"I can speak better on canvas. Painting gives me somewhere to escape to and I can let my feelings out on the canvas," Moore said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>The Michigan native is turning her talent into a business by teaching painting classes at RSVPaint in downtown Springfield. </P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>There, customers pay for a two-hour painting session with Moore or any of the other artists, who give customers a chance to learn how to paint something the artist has designed.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Emily Monroe, who owns RSVPaint, said she met Moore after she answered an advertisement for art instructors for the store.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"She came in for a tryout and painted a&nbsp;picture of pearts&nbsp;that we now use in the class. Its a very handsome piece," she said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Moore said the speech impediment has been something she and her three siblings all have and have had to cope with over the years.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"I used to go to intense speech therapy through grade school. It's hard. It impacts your writing. If you can't speak the words correctly, its hard to learn how to spell them correctly," she said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>But speaking her mind with her painting is not a problem. Influenced by Japanese anime art, Moore has done several paintings in that style, which she started doing again in college.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"My high school art teacher told me to stop painting anime but in college they encouraged me to begin again. At OTC, they let you do what you want and they help you explore things. We were told not to worry about failing," she said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Since attending OTC, Moore has transferred to Missouri State University, where she is furthering her art studies. She wants to eventually return to Michigan for post-graduate studies and either teach or paint.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Now, as an instructor at a local business, Moore is using the teaching techniques she learned at OTC.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"I will be there to answer their questions about technique and such, but I want to push them to explore their own artistic ideas," she said.</P>

		<title>Former OTC student takes talent to Las Vegas</title>

                    <p>If it wasn&rsquo;t for a lost bet, Brian White might be a police officer today instead of performing in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>White, who attended OTC after graduating from Kickapoo High School, is in rehearsals to be a performer in &ldquo;Le Reve,&rdquo; a stunning production at the Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>White, 25, will be one of 93 performers in the production that deals with the dreams of a young girl who falls asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a spectacular production and I have several parts in it,&rdquo; White said.</p>
<p>But if White hadn&rsquo;t lost a bet several years ago while coaching some local gymnasts, he might not have seen the bright lights of Las Vegas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was working at the gym, a group of cheerleaders came in and we were making fun of them. I bet one of the cheerleaders they couldn&rsquo;t perform a certain gymnastics trick. They did it and I had to become a cheerleader,&rdquo; he said. White ended up on the Missouri Elite cheerleading squad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;He turned out to be a very good cheerleader. So good, White earned a cheerleading scholarship to the University of Central Florida. There, he was picked to appear in a movie, &ldquo;Bring It On 4.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A friend he met in the movie joined the &ldquo;Le Reve&rdquo; troupe and called White about eight months ago regarding&nbsp; the tryouts with the production. White tried out and made the production company.</p>
<p>White will do a number of tricks in the production, which requires him to do some underwater work. He drops from a 20-feet tall Chinese fan and does some other gymnastic moves.</p>
<p>His mother, Ann White, who is the secretary to the president of the OTC Richwood Valley campus, said as a mom she&rsquo;s naturally nervous for her son but added, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s so excited. I&rsquo;m so happy for him. It&rsquo;s amazing.&rdquo;</p>

		<title>Former rock drummer teaching at Table Rock</title>

                    <P>It was many Christmases ago that a young Harlow Sanders awoke to fine an authentic drum set sitting in the corner of the family's home.</P>
<P>"There had been an endless succession of toy drums and then one Christmas there was a real set. When I touched it, I realized it wasn't a toy drum. That was it. I was on my way," he said.</P>
<P>From that Christmas on, Sanders rode those drums on a musical career that wound its away across the country, found him playing with groups like Blood, Sweat and Tears, and eventually leading him to Branson music scene. </P>
<P>Today, Sanders teaches English at the OTC Table Rock Campus.</P>
<P>The Pine Bluff, Ark., native jumped back and forth from attending college to pursuing his musical career. He played for a time in Memphis and then went to New York City to study classical music.</P>
<P>While there, he had the opportunity to audition on for Blood Sweat and Tears. He wasnt the band's first choice but when their pick didnt work out, Sanders got the call and toured for a summer.</P>
<P>"I had to memorize the music and I had a week to learn it," he said. "It was fantastic. I loved that music. It was intimidating. As a kid BST music always bothered me. There were licks I couldnt play. It went great."</P>
<P></P>
<P>After that summer, Sanders returned to Arkansas and took his talents to Branson where he played for Shoji Tabuchi and the Lawrence Welk Theater with the Lennon Sisters, playing about two years for each outlet until the mid-1990s.</P>
<P>Sanders decided the music career was over and enrolled at the University of Missouri where he earned his PhD in English education and came to work at the OTC Table Rock Campus when the new campus opened in Hollister last year.</P>
<P>Sanders is one of eight faculty members at the Table Rock campus who hold a doctorate or PhD.</P>
<P></P>
<P>And while Sanders could go elsewhere to teach, he prefers to stay at OTC, where few on campus know of his musical background and most just know him as "Sandy."</P>
<P>"I also enjoy teaching at the Table Rock campus because the administration there is so clearly focused on the Table Rock students," he said. "I'm surrounded by people who do their level best for their students."</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

                    <P>Maricia&nbsp;Zaharuk is a long way from her native country of Romania but the 32-year-old feels very comfortable in her new location in Springfield and at OTC.</P>
<P>"I feel like I was born here. Here is where I belong. I like it here," Zaharuk said.</P>
<P>Not only is Zaharuk trading countries but careers, too. The once-successful singer in a well-known Romanian band is at OTC preparing to become a nurse.</P>
<P>"Its something I think I can do and be good at. I miss the music, but I want to better myself by getting an education. I like the life I have now," she said.</P>
<P>Zaharuk went to a Romanian school for music and recorded her first CD with a band led by Petrica Nicoara when she was 17. </P>
<P>The music is something Zaharuk said was similar to American country music but featured a saxophone and accordion. Nicoara wrote most of the bands songs and the group, according to Zaharuk, was very popular and the most popular band in the country.</P>
<P>During that time, the band traveled through Europe and then came to Anaheim, Calif., in 2000 to play to Romanian communities there and around the country.</P>
<P>After the U.S. tour, Zaharuk returned to Romania but came back to California a short time later and decided to live in California. She had friends in the Ozarks who convinced her to move to Springfield seven years ago.</P>
<P>Zaharuk doesnt sing any more but admits she misses the music.</P>
<P>"Its better for myself to have an education. Ive heard a lot about Branson, but Ive never gone to a show. Ive never tried to sing American songs but I like Carrie Underwood," she said.</P>
<P>But for Zaharuk, now is the time to concentrate on her education, which she started at OTC this semester.</P>
<P>"I was a little worried at first since I dont have any Romanian friends who speak English. Studying is hard but I think Ill do well the first semester," she said.</P>
<P>"The teachers here are very good. They understand me and help me a lot in the classroom. I depend a lot on the OTC people."</P><I>

                    <P>It may just be a flower made out of duct tape to some but to Victoria Johnson, it symbolizes much more.</P>
<P>Johnson, who just graduated from OTC after taking classes at the Waynesville Center, has been selling her handmade duct tape items for about a year. The money she makes for the sale of her goods goes to the local chapter of Relay for Life.</P>
<P>Johnson's business is called Duct for Life and is dedicated to her parents, both of whom were diagnosed with cancer. Her mother is in remission from thyroid and colon cancer since she was diagnosed in 2005. Her father was diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer in 2008.</P>
<P>"I felt when my mom was first diagnosed, I was too young to do anything. I wanted to find a way to help them both and I also wanted to help others," she said</P>
<P>Johnson, who was a teenager when her mother was diagnosed, started participating in the Relay for Life fundraisers, getting donations for walking. </P>
<P>She felt she needed to do more. When a friend showed her last summer how she made things out of duct tape, Johnson decided to give it a try. </P>
<P>"She showed me once and I just started making them. I still have the first rose I made. It reminds me of what I'm trying to do," she said.</P>
<P>She started with some simple flowers made in purple, the official color of Relay for Life. She sold some at last year's event. Now, Johnson's work has expanded to include all sorts of items, including handbags, wallets, roses, hair bows and checkbook covers. The tape on each item is neatly folded, creased and cut. </P>
<P>She has nearly 40 different duct tape prints, everything from argyle to the image of SpongeBob Squarepants to camouflage.</P>
<P>Johnson said she has sold several hundred dollars' worth of items since she started doing it seriously for the last year. Most of the time, she sets up a small table in the center's atrium to sell her items. The items can also be ordered from Johnson's Facebook page at <A href="http://www.facebook.com/DuctForLife">www.facebook.com/DuctForLife</A> </P>
<P>Johnson graduated from OTC in the spring with a transfer degree in psychology and will continue her education at the Waynesville center, taking courses through a collaborative agreement with Central Methodist University.</P>
<P>"OTC has been very helpful to me with my education and this project. It's been a great experience for me," she said.</P>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
                    
                    <P>To say that Rick Hughlett has been involved in Ozarks Technical Community College is quite an understatement.</P>
<P>Even before the start of OTC, Mr. Hughlett was right there getting his formal automotive training at Graff Vocational Technical School, which later became OTC. He was on the Automotive Technology advisory board at Graff and then continued to hold the same position at OTC.</P>
<P>He's a member of the OTC Foundation and last May was awarded the colleges Distinguished Alumni Award. He and his wife, Karen, have endowed the Rick and Karen Hughlett Scholarship for students in the colleges automotive program.</P>
<P>Today, Mr. Hughlett, owner of Rick's Automotive, offers training to OTC students at his business and has hired OTC graduates to fill positions at his 30-year-old business </P>
<P>A key hire almost 13 years ago was Bill Murcko, an OTC graduate who took second in the nation in the SkillsUSA automotive competition. Today, Murcko is a technician for Hughlett who helps oversee the company's ambulance maintenance and repair work done for vehicles in a 16-county area.</P>
<P></P>
<P>He was instrumental in the formation of the Advisory Committee of area automotive service providers to work with the OTC Transportation Department, and he offers a mentoring program for students from OTC's Automotive Repair program.</P>
<P></P>
<P>There may be no better cheerleader for the college and its mission than Mr. Hughlett.</P>
<P>"OTC is here for the community. Springfield is reliant on the construction industry, but when a Lily Tulip or Zenith closes, you see the impact close up. You see the empty parking lots. You don't see that when it happens in the construction industry. Thats when OTC comes in and does its part, " he said. </P>
<P>"OTC has the retraining for those who leave the construction field for another job. OTC is poised to help with nursing training, Middle College, all kinds of training."</P>
<P>Mr. Hughlett takes pride when he hears OTC being compliment by residents and business owners throughout the region.</P>
<P>"It's not uncommon to hear people on the street talk about how proud they are to have OTC here and what its done for our community. It has helped raise the level of income here. OTC is now branching out into other communities and offering courses online. It's going to keep growing," he said.</P>
<P>?Mr. Hughlett knows the kind of impact OTC has on the regional business landscape.</P>
<P>"If OTC weren't here to offer training for people to get a good job, we'd all be selling hamburgers to each other. People would have to move to get the kind of training OTC offers," he said. </P>
<P>"OTC has exceeded my expectations of what the college could mean for the region. How lucky are we to have it? Its fun to be a part of and Im honored to be on their Foundation board."</P>
<P> </P>

                    <P>The fourth-annual OTC Community Day will offer visitors a chance to experience how to survive a zombie attack, donate to a worthy cause and check out the latest in beautifully restored cars and trucks.</P>
<P>Community Day is April 27 from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. on the OTC Springfield Campus. Dozens of programs will conduct demonstrations, offer various useful services and provide a large number of entertaining play stations for children.</P>
<P>Jennifer Dunkel, lead instructor for developmental writing at OTC, said the zombie project started as a sophomore seminar and is a program to teach hands-on survival skills using the popular zombie theme as the basis for the class.</P>
<P>At Community Day, students will demonstrate a variety of survival skills including Bug-Out-Bags, which will show the public what to pack in advance in case of an emergency. They will also have hands-on demonstrations of water purification, solar cooking, and basic first aid, all necessary skills for emergency situations.</P>
<P>"Students have also created an interactive 'Zombie Infection' game to show how quickly a zombie virus could spread. Community Day seemed a fitting event to get the word out about zombie survival tips through demonstrations that the entire community can learn from," Dunkel said.</P>
<P>The annual welding repair day will be in place again, with a $10 donation asked of those wanting an item welded. The work will be done by current and former welding students. The money is being donated to the Breast Cancer Foundation of the Ozarks.</P>
<P>The annual OTC Car and Truck show is expected to draw more than 100 entrants with trophies awarded in a wide variety of categories.</P>
<P>The day will also feature the annual plant sale along with tables and booths offering demonstrations, health screenings, and hands-on projects. The Colleges new Mobile Hearing Instrument vehicle will be on display along with manikins from the Colleges new simulation center. The Springfield-Greene County Library's Bookmobile will be on site again.</P>
<P>For more information on Community Day and to register for the car show, go to <A href="http://www.otc.edu/communityday"><U>www.otc.edu/communityday</U></A>.</P>

		<title>Fox KRBK to host "American Idol" auditions at OTC Richwood Valley Campus</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
                    
                    <p>While Saturday marks the first time &ldquo;American Idol&rdquo; auditions have been held at the OTC Richwood Valley campus, it won&rsquo;t the first time some OTC staff have been involved with the highly popular talent show.</p>
<p>Ryan Farmer, customer service manager of the OTC Bookstore, and Dana Mason, the college&rsquo;s coordinator of public relations, have both auditioned for the Fox show. Hunter will be trying his luck again on Saturday for the FOX KRBK Idol auditions.</p>
<p>The winner will be guaranteed an audition in front of an &ldquo;American Idol&rdquo; producer in Oklahoma City July 20, along with travel expense money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go. I live in Nixa and I think it&rsquo;s cool that &lsquo;American Idol&rsquo; would be providing the experience for a smaller city but I&rsquo;m not sure what to expect,&rdquo; the 25-year-old Farmer said.</p>
<p>Farmer, who has appeared in several musical productions at Springfield Little Theater, was 19 when he auditioned in 2006 in Memphis. He and more than 20,000 others showed up to audition.</p>
<p>Mason auditioned twice: In Dallas in 2007, for season 7, and in Chicago in 2009, for season 9.&nbsp; Both times, she was one of about 13,000 people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We saw everything from the &lsquo;serious singers,&rsquo; warming up their voices and performing for anyone who will listen, to the ones who come in costume, hoping that they&rsquo;ll be good TV, even if they aren&rsquo;t a good singer,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Farmer said of his experience: &ldquo;You wait for hours to sing for 30 seconds of your life. It was overwhelming. It&rsquo;s long hours and many, many people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mason said, &ldquo;It was a lot of build-up and excitement, and then the whole thing was over in about a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Organizers of Saturday&rsquo;s event here aren&rsquo;t sure how many will be coming to the Richwood Valley campus. Estimates range from the hundreds to more than 1,000. It could be the largest one-day crowd that&rsquo;s been on the Christian County campus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very excited to host the &lsquo;American Idol&rsquo; auditions.&nbsp; This is a fantastic opportunity to showcase the campus and the beautiful building we have at Richwood Valley,&rdquo; said OTC Richwood Valley President Jeff Jochems.</p>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Talisia Ensch knows she&rsquo;s going to cry when she receives her GED Sunday at the Gillioz Theater.</p>
<p>Ensch of Branson and a recovering addict will have accomplished something Sunday she didn&rsquo;t think was possible a few years ago &mdash; get her diploma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one more thing I&rsquo;ve overcome and it&rsquo;s important in my life. Yes, I&rsquo;m going to cry,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Ensch, 25, who left school at the 11<sup>th</sup> grade, is one of more than 300 students who will be honored by Ozarks Technical Community College at Sunday&rsquo;s ceremonies. One program begins at 1 p.m. and the second starts at 3:30 p.m. The public is invited to attend.</p>
<p>A video report of last year&rsquo;s ceremony is on the News-Leader website.</p>
<p>More than 3,000 students participate in OTC&rsquo;s Adult Education and Learning programs each year throughout the Ozarks, with some of them working for this GED. When students complete their GED work, they receive their first three credit hours of college coursework free from OTC.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot of the students in the program are displaced workers from across southwest Missouri,&rdquo; said Ramona George, director of OTC&rsquo;s Adult Education and Learning.</p>
<p>Michelle Gray of Springfield is one such person who will receive her diploma.</p>
<p>Gray said her layoff from Willowbrook in the fall was &ldquo;a blessing in disguise&rdquo; and gave her a chance to improve her life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was hard work and I&rsquo;m proud of me. I was scared at first returning to school. It was the first time since 1986,&rdquo; said the married mother of four.</p>
<p>Robin Willis of Seymour, who dropped out of high school more than 20 years ago, drove almost 75 miles round trip nearly every day in order to complete her GED work and also took college courses at OTC while studying for her diploma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just going to see where it takes me,&rdquo; Willis said.</p>

		<title>GED services marked by emotions, excitement</title>

                    <p>Few ceremonies at Ozarks Technical Community College are filled with as much excitement and emotion as the College&rsquo;s GED graduation services.</p>
<p>On Sunday, more than 300 people will ride that emotional wave across the Gillioz Theater stage and receive their GED in front of enthusiastic family members and friends.</p>
<p>Two services are scheduled for 1 and 3 p.m.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can be very emotional for the students,&rdquo; said Ramona George, director of the GED and adult education programs at OTC. &ldquo;Those are real emotions, real stuff going on among the families in the audience. The students are walking across that stage not only for themselves but for their entire family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George said the program gives people a second change in life. Of the 2,900 who studied for their GED last year, 1,500 reported that they were unemployed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That number has been going up over the years because people are finding it difficult to be competitive in the workforce without a diploma. Many have exhausted the job market looking for work, and they have to go back and learn new skills to keep their job or earn a promotion,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Tim Mayes of Aurora will receive his GED Sunday. Facing a bleak future after he was laid off from his welding job with the Paul Mueller Co. last year, Mayes now dreams of supporting his wife and 2-year-old daughter by becoming a law-enforcement officer. He has applied to the Lawrence County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know what I was going to do after being laid off,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I had been welding all my life. I didn&rsquo;t need to use writing and reading.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mayes, one of 2,900 student who studied for their GED at OTC facilities through the region this year, was referred to OTC through the Missouri Career Center. He worked for five months on getting his diploma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is one of the best things I ever accomplished. I never thought it would happen. People said I wouldn&rsquo;t accomplish anything. My family was a big part of my success,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>OTC President Dr. Hal Higdon said he especially enjoys the celebratory fervor at the ceremonies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;There is a special atmosphere that surrounds the GED services. Families celebrate the accomplishments of their loved ones, knowing they have reached a significant goal in their lives. Their joy is reflected in the enthusiasm shown at the ceremonies,&rdquo; Hidgon said.</p>

		<title>Geology class takes field trip to rock formations</title>

                    <P></P>
<P>When OTC geology instructor Kathryn Shade saw the advantage of moving her classroom outside and off campus, she took jumped at the chance.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Shade recently took a group of her students to the Johnson's Shut-Ins and Elephant Rock state parks in southeastern Missouri where they spent several days hiked several trails, observed rocks and discussed their formation and the rocks history.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Johnson's Shut-Ins State Park is on the Black River and the river cascades in and around the igneous rocks worn smooth by the water. Elephant Rocks is made up of an outcropping of&nbsp;Precambrian&nbsp;granite boulders that resemble a train of pink&nbsp;circus&nbsp;elephants.</P>
<P></P>
<P>"The purpose of the trip was to introduce students to a part of Missouris geologic history and more specifically to allow them to observe evidence of the volcanic history of the St. Francios Mountains area in southwest Missouri," Shade said. </P>
<P>"They climbed on, hiked over and observed plutonic igneous rocks (granite) at Elephant Rocks State Park and volcanic igneous rocks (primarily rhyolite) at Johnson's Shut-ins State Park."</P>
<P>Shade took other classes to the area last spring and this trip was as successful as the one last year.</P>
<P></P>
<P>"Students seemed to enjoy it and learn from it. They appeared to gain from the experience on multiple levels  learning geology, appreciating the environment, getting some good exercise and fresh air, testing their camping skills, and earning some credit for class," she said.</P>
<P>Andy Norton, a student from Springfield who made the trip, said it was good to see the real-world application of what he was learning in class.</P>
<P>"I love science. I've always been a daydreamer. I like studying science in the real world instead of in a book," he said. "I had never seen volcanic material before and all the rocks on the river.</P>
<P>Norton, who wants to study astronomy, said coming to OTC for science classes has been good for him. </P>
<P>"That notion of 'Start here, go anywhere' that you hear a lot works for me," he said.</P>
<P>Shade said she thinks the trip was a success.</P>
<P></P>
<P>"I think those that attended learned more deeply about Missouri geology than they would have sitting in class, and they can now take family and friends to some great state parks and feel comfortable about knowing the area and amenities," she said.</P>
<P>"I'm pretty sure they will always remember what granite and rhyolite look like, and which rock formed by cooling slowly underground and which cooled quickly after being ejected from a volcano."</P>

                    <p>A bit of history will be made at this year's Ozarks Technical  Community College's commencement exercise on Thursday.</p>
<p>Gov. Jay Nixon will be the first Missouri governor to  address an OTC graduating class. The ceremony will begin at 6 p.m. at  JQH Arena.</p>
<p>"We are  very honored to have the governor participate in the ceremony," OTC  President Hal L. Higdon said. "Gov. Nixon has always been a champion for  the state's community colleges and the graduates will be thrilled to  hear from him."</p>
<p>More  than 1,000 graduates are eligible to receive degrees or certificates  they earned during the 2010-11 school year. About half the graduates are  expected to participate in the ceremony, which will be attended by  thousands of family members and friends.</p>
<p>"This class represents yet another significant  contribution that OTC makes to the region's workforce with graduates  filling a wide variety of career opportunities," said Shirley Lawler,  vice president for academic and student affairs.</p>
<p>Before next Thursday's commencement, another  significant graduation ceremony will be held.</p>
<p>The second annual OTC Middle College graduation will  be held at 6 p.m. Sunday at the Gillioz Theatre in downtown Springfield.  A total of 31 graduates will receive their high school diplomas.</p>
<p>"As we graduate our  second class of 31 seniors and we look at the impact it has made on  their individual lives, I marvel at the positive changes we see in our  seniors," Middle College Director LaRaine Bauer said.</p>
<p>The Middle College, the only one of its kind in the  state, is an alternative education high school located on OTC's  Springfield campus in partnership with Springfield Public Schools.</p>
<p>Students attending  Middle College can earn high school diplomas while simultaneously  enrolling in college classes and beginning work experiences through  local internships in their career path.</p>
<p>Middle College study programs include  diesel/automotive technology, early childhood development and medical  service.</p>
<p>"We are  really proud of the success of the Middle College, and we owe it all to  the mutual collaboration between OTC and Springfield Public Schools to  create a contemporary model of education unique to the state of  Missouri," Bauer said.</p>

                    <p>By Steve Koehler</p>
<p>Ozarks Technical Community College was the first stop Thursday, October 22 for Gov. Jay Nixon&rsquo;s listening tour to discuss ways to help higher education better connect with the state&rsquo;s workforce demands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In these challenging times, it&rsquo;s clear that the demand for higher education is increasing in Missouri,&rdquo; Nixon said. &ldquo;Our challenge will be to ensure that the types of trained workers businesses need are ready and available. This conversation, and others like it around the state, will ensure that our community colleges are prepared to accomplish that mission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nixon, who is visiting all of the state&rsquo;s community colleges, toured OTC&rsquo;s diesel and automotive repair facilities and held a roundtable discussion with college administrators and business leaders about ways the state can connect higher education to its economic needs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we look at funding and expansion of funding, we want to match it up with programs that are in demand,&rdquo; Nixon told. &ldquo;This is not complicated but it is extremely crucial. It&rsquo;s a matter of adding momentum to what already works.&rdquo;</p>
<p>OTC&rsquo;s president, Dr. Hal Higdon, said the College&rsquo;s focus is &ldquo;getting people in, getting them trained and getting them to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The College has been able to meet workforce needs by constantly staying in touch with the business community.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Advisory groups tell us what&rsquo;s coming and what&rsquo;s needed in various areas. We can start and stop programs as the economy changes,&rdquo; Higdon said.</p>
<p>Nixon praised OTC for having the ability to be agile in responding to economic conditions with short and streamlined programs in everything from construction readiness, truck driving to pharmacy technician.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At four-year institutions, it would take years to go out and do that. OTC works at the speed of business,&rdquo; Nixon said.</p>
<p>In the healthcare area, OTC has started a new registered nursing program and an evening EMT program as a result of the demand.</p>
<p>Kim Day, president and CEO of St. John&rsquo;s Health Systems, said OTC gave St. John&rsquo;s a great deal of help when the hospital&rsquo;s nursing program reached capacity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have been able to work with OTC to obtain training in various healthcare fields,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Steve Edwards, executive vice president and Chief Operating Officer of Cox Health Systems, told Nixon that the hospital receives 300 applications a day for 140 openings but none of the applicants is qualified for the positions.</p>
<p>He credited OTC with help in the training of potential applicants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Filling vacancies is very, very important. OTC&rsquo;s programs have been a godsend,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Higdon said OTC is training students for careers of the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Whether it&rsquo;s in health care, automotive mechanics or computer technology, our workforce development and degree programs help students succeed in challenging and rewarding careers,&rdquo; Higdon said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We look forward to continuing this dialogue with Gov. Nixon in the coming weeks to determine the best ways to make our programs more accessible for Missouri students, and more beneficial for Missouri businesses.&rdquo;</p>

		<title>Graduate goes from graphics to pizza</title>

                    <P>Nate Doran studied graphic design, digital arts and photography at Ozarks Technical Community College and as a result, he now operated The Big Slice N.Y. Style Pizzaria.</P>
<P>"By degree warped into a food career," said Doran, who graduated from OTC in 2011 with an associates degree in graphic design.</P>
<P>After finding a limited job market in design, Doran turned to his other talent of food, which he picked up while working a number of Springfield restaurants while going to school. There he rubbed elbows with OTC culinary students.</P>
<P>His experience found him in the kitchens of the Brown Egg, Rebecca's Grille and Valentine's.</P>
<P>"I learned recipes there that I use in my place including my own salad dressing and pizza dough," he said.</P>
<P>The new pizza joint on East Sunshine Street has only been open for about two months but has been doing a booking business with Ozarkers and former New York City folks who have come the Springfield.</P>
<P>"It's been crazy busy, a great reception. There a group form New York who come in here every day," Doran said.</P>
<P>Some of his customers are from New Jersey, too. In fact, the first dollar Doran took in when the place opened was from a New Jersey resident. When the New York group saw that, they insisted Doran put a dollar from them. Both bills are framed and hanging on a wall near the cash register.</P>
<P>A New York pizza, which has a thicker crust that the traditional St. Louis-style thin crust, is also much larger. How large?</P>
<P>"It the size of a small car," Doran said with a laugh. </P>
<P>The large is somewhere in the 18- to 21-inch range and made with a variety of topping from the traditional Sicilian meat pizza to a creamy spinach topping. Doran also makes garlic knots, small balls of dough drenched with fresh garlic.</P>
<P>Doran doesn't have a favorite pizza. He likes making all of them but the creamy spinach seems to be a customer favorite.</P>
<P>Doran isn't the only one with an OTC connection. His fiancé, Stephanie Grant, will start at the college this fall and will study nursing.</P>
<P>"OTC was an awesome place to study," Doran said. "I learned a lot and was glad I went."</P>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>Bob Schieffer, host of TV&rsquo;s &ldquo;Face the Nation,&rdquo; said it best Sunday when he talked about college graduation and the celebration of achievement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Graduations are good for what ails you. If you're feeling a little out of sorts and want to feel better, here's a thought: Find a graduation and go to it,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>We couldn&rsquo;t agree more and hope the public will join us Thursday, May 14, to watch hundreds of students graduate from Ozarks Technical Community College and take a giant step into their future.</p>
<p>Thousands of family members and friends, along with the College&rsquo;s Board of Trustees, administrators, faculty and staff, will gather in the JQH Arena at 6 p.m. for this annual celebration of students who have worked hard to better themselves through education.</p>
<p>Graduation is a remarkable family event. For every student receiving their degree, there are four, five, even 10 or more family members and friends in the audience cheering their loved one&rsquo;s success.</p>
<p>The graduate&rsquo;s &ldquo;second family&rdquo; &mdash;&nbsp;the board members, administrators, faculty and staff at OTC &mdash;&nbsp;is overjoyed to see the students receive their degrees, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a proud time. It means a lot to all of us to see students walking in together with faculty,&rdquo; said OTC President Dr. Hal Higdon.</p>
<p>Taxpayers should be happy, too, and join the celebration as they see their investment in OTC produce graduates who will join the tax-paying workforce.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s graduating class will include more than 50 who carried a perfect 4.0 grade point average. Degrees will be conferred in all program disciplines, including: early childhood development, nursing, applied science, culinary arts and health information technology.</p>
<p>Dr. Higdon said the public should attend the commencement to remind themselves of a hopeful future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want to feel good about humanity, come to a community college graduation,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p><em>Steve Koehler is coordinator of publications at Ozarks Technical Community College.<br /></em></p>

                    <p>By Steve Koehler</p>
<p>Students who love computers, art and design are enrolling in Ozarks Technical Community College&rsquo;s popular Graphic Design program.</p>
<p>One of the top 10 programs on campus based on enrollment, the program exposes students to various graphic techniques, everything from screen-printing to computer design to online publishing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We live in a visual world and a visual-design society,&rdquo; said Cheryl Feller, a graphic design instructor. &ldquo;People don&rsquo;t want a plain, old trash can. They wan a colorful trash can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Feller said the program&rsquo;s popularity is due in large part to allowing students to express themselves visually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Students are interested in the technology of today&rsquo;s world and what it offers them in terms of expression. They want to come and try it out,&rdquo; Feller said.</p>
<p>Amy Ricklefs of Fair Grove brought her interest in magazine page design with her from high school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t get it out of my head and wanted to come to OTC to continue working on it. I really like the photo-editing software. I like page layout and would like to get into hospital magazine design work,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>After graduation in May, Ricklefs would like to find work and also continue her studies in design at Drury University.</p>
<p>Feller said in order to prepare students for employment, the college keeps up with the never-ending equipment and software updates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We update on a regular basis and keep up with industry standards especially when it comes to software,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Olivia Ezell wants to graduate with a graphic design degree and transfer to Missouri State to study photography and design.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The program teaches you to take your love and talent for art and transfer it into something you can communicate with,&rdquo; she said.</p>

		<title>Group collects clothing for student job seekers</title>

                    <P>Anyone heading out to a job interview wants to look their best to make a good impression but so some, owning a professional outfit can be a challenge.</P>
<P>But a group at Ozarks Technical Community College is trying to assist those in need of professional clothing with a drive to collect suits, dressing shirts, dresses and blouses.</P>
<P>The student chapter of the International Association of Administrative Professionals conducted its on-campus clothing drive last week at the spring student picnic and now is asking the community to contribute as well to restock its Community Clothing Closet.</P>
<P>"People have been great," said Gail Garton, lead online instructor for business who has been helping oversee the clothing drive for a number of years. "We have some students who dont have the funds to buy good clothes for a job interview. The demand for the clothes has really increased."</P>
<P>The clothing helps students be proud and confident going into the interview or other career-advancing event like a job fair. It's a primary resource for some of the students who get the appropriate clothing they need and the service is free.</P>
<P>Students can cull through the clothing collection that is kept in a large storage room. There they can privately pick what they need. The group has also collected unworn clothing from local businesses as well as gift certificates for free hair grooming.</P>
<P>Sadie Hoper, from the college's financial aid office and one of the drives coordinators, said the closet tends to run out of things.</P>
<P>"We thought we'd have a drive to replenish the closet. There are a lot of students who are in need. They want to dress and look nice for an interview," she said.</P>
<P>Melanie Allen, another coordinator, said shes had good response from local businesses.</P>
<P>"I've gotten gift certificates for haircuts and several businesses have given up brand-new clothing, no questions asked. That's so nice of them to do," she said.</P>
<P>If you have appropriate business attire including suits, ties, belts, handbags, briefcases, shoes, all-season coats, skirts or shirts to donate, contact Hoper at <A href="mailto:hoppers@otc.edu"><U>hoppers@otc.edu</U></A> or Garton at <A href="mailto:gartong@otc.edu"><U>gartong@otc.edu</U></A>.</P>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>A family with more than a half century of registered nurses already to its credit added a third generation to its ranks Wednesday when Julie David received her RN pin from Ozarks Technical Community College Wednesday night.</p>
<p>David, of Walnut Grove, was pinned by her grandmother, Jeannie David, who is still an active nurse after 55 years. David&rsquo;s mother became a registered nurse last year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It meant everything for my grandmother to be here. It was inspirational to follow in her footsteps,&rdquo; said Julie David, who has accepted a job a school nurse for the Willard School District.</p>
<p>David was one of 24 in the first class of RNs to graduate from the College&rsquo;s Associate of Science in Nursing program. The group received their pins in a ceremony at the Gillioz Theater before an audience of more than 200 family members and friends.</p>
<p>Jeannie David was overjoyed by the chance to pin her granddaughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was very excited,&rdquo; she said after the ceremony.</p>
<p>Dr. Hal Higdon, president of OTC, said the ceremony marked a historic moment for the graduates and the College.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tonight, we took 24 people and doubled their earning potential from what it was yesterday. Think of what that means to a family. It will change the standard of living for their family,&rdquo; Higdon said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the life of the college, this is a major step that we now have an RN program. It&rsquo;s a small program now, but it&rsquo;s going to grow and as it grows, it can only help the community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sherry Taylor, the program&rsquo;s director, said she was excited to see the first class graduate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very proud of them. They are an exceptional group of students,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Tabitha Caye Burton, one of the graduates who spoke at the service, said: &ldquo;The journey has been an experience we will never forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taylor said that the class size will expand to 30 in the fall because of the high demand for the classes. She said the program is helping fill a need for skilled nurses in the region.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a good, strong allied healthcare program. This is helping with the nursing shortage,&rdquo; she said.</p>

                    <P></P>
<P>Dr. Lawrence Brethower will soon be putting his classroom on wheels and heading down the highway, a first for Ozarks Technical Community College.</P>
<P>Brethower is director of the College's Hearing Instrument Science program, just one of three programs like it in the country.</P>
<P>Now, he has created a version of the traditional classroom program that will be offered inside a specialized, state-of-the-art mobile transport that resembles a recreational vehicle.</P>
<P>Equipped with desks, instruments and other special equipment, Brethower will take the vehicle to community colleges around the state to train students in hearing instrument sciences.</P>
<P>In 2013, Missouri will begin requiring a two-year associate's degree for anyone who fits customers with a hearing aid. Previously, the only training available for this career was on-the-job training, frequently on just one specific make of hearing aid.</P>
<P>"The population is aging and there is a growing demand for trained and licensed specialists in dealing with the instruments involved," Brethower said. </P>
<P>The program offers hands-on laboratory training in a wide variety of skills, as well as clinical internships with area specialists.</P>
<P>Developed with funds from Gov. Jay Nixon's Training for Tomorrow grant, the program is now funded by a grant from the U.S. Department of Labor. Both grants were designed to educate Missourians in high-tech fields and get them working in growing industries. </P>
<P>The first group of students that started in 2010 will graduate in December; a majority of the class has already received job offers.</P>
<P>"A graduate can go to work for a company or be self-employed. Specialists can work their way up to a good living wage," Brethower said, adding that self-employed specialists can make upwards of $80,000 a year.</P>
<P>Dr. Brethower said the program is designed for someone looking for a career change or looking to learn new skills. It's a win for those in need of work and for those businesses needing a specialist.</P>
<P>"We want to produce craftspeople who will meet the challenges of the hearing impaired," Brethower said. "Taking this statewide, with more people out of work, folks can retool themselves and learn a special skill set."</P>

                    <p>By Steve Koehler</p>
<p>OTC President Hal Higdon told an audience of more than 1.5 million listeners in the New York, Baltimore and Boston areas recently that the college is retraining thousands of students who are looking for a new career.</p>
<p>Higdon appeared this week on a segment of &nbsp;&ldquo;The Takeaway,&rdquo; a radio program originating from WNYC, the largest National Public Radio station in the country. Higdon participated in a discussion about retraining displaced workers in a down economy.</p>
<p>The president was invited on the show following Gov. Joy Nixon&rsquo;s visit to OTC last week to see some of OTC&rsquo;s retraining efforts.</p>
<p>Higdon was interviewed by the show&rsquo;s host John Hockenberry and program contributor Beth Kobliner. The program airs in New York City, Boston, Baltimore and much of the East Coast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of 13,000 students at OTC, at least half are involved in technical or allied health programs designed to get them to work within a 24-month period,&rdquo; Higdon told the audience.</p>
<p>Hockenberry said that nationally there has been an emphasis on training workers for green jobs and Higdon pointed out that at OTC, there is ongoing green training in the areas of HVAC, energy auditing and construction trades along with other areas that support green jobs.</p>
<p>Higdon added that displaced workers are happy to come to OTC for retraining.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have that happening a great deal. These are typically workers from low-skill jobs who need a GED,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Higdon said prior to the show&rsquo;s airing that the issue of retraining workers is that community colleges are willing to tackle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s been a change in attitude in the value of the community college,&rdquo; Higdon said.</p>

		<title>High-tech manikins help in training students</title>

                    <P></P>
<P>To some, they may appear to be lifeless imitations of human beings made of hard plastic and stuffed with wires and electronics. But to Michelle Howard, director of OTC's Simulation Center, the electronically elaborate manikins represent the cutting edge in medical training that will eventually save lives. </P>
<P></P>
<P>These manikins mimic a myriad of medical conditions that test the skills and abilities of emergency personnel. Each computer-driven manikin can bleed, sweat, speak and move. They can produce symptoms of everything from a heart attack to a drug overdose to a concussion.</P>
<P></P>
<P>"These manikins will provide hands-on experience in addition to what the students are learning in textbooks. Our students will take that knowledge and apply it in clinical settings," Howard said.</P>
<P></P>
<P>"With the manikins, they are working in a real-life situation but it's safe and won't harm anyone. We can teach them, with the use of the manikins, to be careful practitioners."</P>
<P></P>
<P>A new simulation center opened in November. The $1.25 million project was paid for with state and local grants, including funds from the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, the Community Foundation of the Ozarks and the Sunderland Corporation. </P>
<P></P>
<P>The rooms of the new facility are dedicated to different aspects of patient care, ranging from an emergency room setting to a surgical room. Birthing scenarios can be simulated, as well as emergencies that might take place in an apartment or a kitchen. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Observation windows will allow instructors to see how the students react to the situations they confront.</P>
<P></P>
<P>"All of the equipment and computer systems used are state-of-the-art. It's the best on the market and provides a very realistic environment," she said.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Students from many of the college's Allied Health programs, along with a number of outside agencies, have been using the college's manikins, including EMTs from Cox Health Systems, the Missouri National Guard (inset photo) and the University of Missouri.</P>
<P></P>
<P>"Manikins training is here to stay and it's not going away," Howard said. "The use of manikins is improving patient outcomes and helping prevent wrongful deaths. We are at the cutting edge with this center."</P>

		<title>HIS program uses actors to help train students</title>

                    <SPAN lang=EN>
<P dir=ltr align=left>The older gentleman sat quietly on a chair as an OTC student began probing in his ears.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>The man, known as Jerry, was a patient in the Hearing Instrument Science lab at OTC for an examination after he suddenly had pain in his ear after dental surgery.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>The student, Sarah Woods of Springfield, was examining him for any hearing damage done as a result of the operation. </P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>But Jerry wasn't really Jerry. Jerry is Jim Slaughter, a local actor, hired to present hearing medical issues to OTC students training in the HIS field.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>The scenarios the actors present are based on real life, said Larry Brethower, OTC's director of Hearing Instrument Science. </P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Michelle Howard, college director of OTCs simulation center, said actors of various ages are given scenarios and symptoms in a script that they go over and use when students examine them. </P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"We realize the value for students when we provide them with patients in a clinical setting that can take place throughout the day. That way, they are more prepared and familiar with the equipment when they are employed," she said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"We threw out a wide net in the community looking for actors, including our own faculty and college theater programs, she said, adding that they are paid a small part-time hourly amount for their time."</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>In addition to using live actors, Howard's corps of manikins is put to use for students to practice more evasive procedures that could be an issue for actors.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"The manikin encounters are for procedures that could be dangerous but we still want the student to experience it," Brethower said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>The manikin can be programmed to talk to the student during a procedure.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"Oh, what are you doing?" one asked a student. "Why are you doing both ears?"</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Students are observed by the instructor on how they do with the live actors and the manikins. A debriefing is later held so students receive feedback.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Brethower and Howard are collaborating on a paper about the work they are doing with actors and manikins for publication soon in Hearing Review magazine. Their unique approach may be the only one of its kind in the region.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"The idea makes use of the great facility we have here with the use of the manikins and the actors for the benefit of preparing students for real-life situations," Howard said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P></SPAN>

		<title>HIT program goes completely online</title>

                    <P>This fall, the Health Information Technology program at OTC became the first HIT program in the state to be offered completely online.</P>
<P>And judging by the enrollment numbers of this first year, the move has been a good one. The program is at capacity with between 250 and 300 declared majors enrolled in either full or part time in classes.</P>
<P>"This program is really meeting the needs of the students," said Sue Kirk, HIT program director.</P>
<P>"Online offers the program to those people who don't live within an easy traveling distance to the college. They have childcare issues, they work full-time or they cant afford the gas prices."</P>
<P>The program has drawn students from across the country, including some from Las Vegas and Omaha, Neb.</P>
<P>"I get calls all the time from people who are looking for an online option of the program," Kirk said. </P>
<P>HIT is a program that is in demand by both students and employers like local health providers Mercy and CoxHealth.</P>
<P>"Students see healthcare as a reliable job and there is a huge push in the healthcare industry for all patient information to be in an electronic transmittable format," Kirk said.</P>
<P>Plus, healthcare providers are looking to free up space to offer more services and those in medical records or auditing positions can work from home.</P>
<P>Thats what Brian Gray does as a senior compliance specialist in the revenue compliance department for Mercy.</P>
<P>Gray, who graduated from OTC in 2009, said staying focused at home can be a challenge but having access to his work 24/7 helps him to complete it.</P>
<P>"I can dress a little more casual. I don't work in pajamas. Getting dressed reminds me that I am at work and doing work. Sometimes, I do go out and talk to doctors about accounts Im auditing," he said.</P>
<P>Nancy Chambers, who graduated from OTC in 201o, is a clinical coding auditor/educator in the Audit &amp; Compliance Department for CoxHealth.</P>
<P>"Im glad I made the choice to enter this field. The program is tough and the expectations are high so I had to push myself," said Chambers, who had worked in other fields. </P>
<P>"There's a lot of variety to my job and I enjoy what do."</P><I>
<P> </P></I>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="vertical-align: baseline;"><span>On Monday, Ozarks Technical Community College will begin a three-day accreditation process with the Higher Learning Commission.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="vertical-align: baseline;"><span>&nbsp;Five HLC team members will be on campus, meeting with everyone from the college&rsquo;s Board of Trustees to faculty and staff, to determine if OTC meets the commission&rsquo;s criteria for continued accreditation.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="vertical-align: baseline;"><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;We look forward to the HLC evaluation process and we&rsquo;ll benefit from the input of the accreditation team. We have to remember that the team is here to assist us and help us grow as a institution of higher education,&rdquo; said Shirley Lawler, vice president for academic and student affairs.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="vertical-align: baseline;"><span>&ldquo;The HLC&rsquo;s accreditation process is a very rigorous evaluation system that allows us to do a critical self-analysis of our college. We have reviewed every aspect of our institution and our self-study represents two years of reviewing our current processes and procedures.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="vertical-align: baseline;"><span>A steering committee made up of members of the college&rsquo;s faculty and staff produced the self-study.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="vertical-align: baseline;"><span>The team will meet with the college&rsquo;s administration, vice presidents, deans, directors, community representatives, students, faculty and staff for three days, discussing programs, procedures and other related items.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="vertical-align: baseline;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Members of the team have read our self-study report and will be confirming the validity of the document. They will also help us plan for the future by identifying areas of strength and areas for improvement,&rdquo; said Witt Salley, co-coordinator of OTC&rsquo;s self-study steering committee.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="vertical-align: baseline;"><span>The accreditation is important to the college, students and the community.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="vertical-align: baseline;"><span>&ldquo;Maintaining accreditation allows OTC to say to everyone that we not only offer a quality education but also that we value effective teaching and support student learning,&rdquo; Lawler said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="vertical-align: baseline;"><span>For students, being an HLC-accredited college means they can obtain federal financial aid. Nursing and the physical therapy assistant programs need the HLC accreditation before they can apply for specialized affiliations for their programs.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="vertical-align: baseline;"><span>The college&rsquo;s self-study and other material about the accreditation visit are available at </span><a href="http://www.otc.edu/selfstudy/selfstudy.php"><span>http://www.otc.edu/selfstudy</span></a><span>.</span></p>

		<title>Home-schooled students have a path toward OTC</title>

                    <SPAN lang=EN>
<P dir=ltr align=left>There are more than 4,500 families in the Ozarks who home school their children and when they look for advanced education, they can look to OTC for those opportunities.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Recently, the Southwest Home Education Ministry (SHEM) and representatives from OTC's Dual Credit Program met at the Library Center in Springfield to review what's available for high-school aged students.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"The OTC presentation in collaboration with SHEM, was a huge success," said Teri Shepard, SHEM board member. "Not only did we have a packed house, but following the event, we had additional requests for a second event."</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Kim Greene, coordinator of dial credit and high school admissions at OTC, said southwest Missouri has an extremely active homeschool population.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"Many parents and students know the options for secondary education, but are not aware of all of the college programs a student can begin before achieving a diploma," she said. "It is definitely an area of outreach OTC wants to pursue to better serve our area students so they can get a jumpstart on college and complete more quickly which in turn, gets them out in the workforce, which is ultimately OTCs goal."</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Greene said there are options for home-schooled students to consider when deciding on dual-credit courses.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"The most popular option is our online dual-credit courses. Students work with OTC's Dual Credit department to get enrolled in online courses. These courses are $35 per credit hour with a $65 online course fee," she said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>There are also many on-campus options for students. Any student who is at least 16 can attend classes at an OTC campus as an Early Start student. They pay regular tuition, but it does provide those students a jump on their college education.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Tracy McGrady, OTC's dean of academic and student affairs at Richwood Valley and who oversees dual enrollment programs, said its OTC's goal to extend the same opportunities to home-schooled students as to those offered to area high school students.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"We started asking ourselves how we could serve this population better, and it was an easy decision to extend the same dual-credit opportunities to them as well," she said. </P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>More information on dual credit classes is available at </SPAN><A href="http://www.otc.edu/dualcredit/dualcredit.php"><SPAN lang=EN>www.otc.edu/dualcredit/dualcredit.php</SPAN></A><SPAN lang=EN>.

                    <SPAN lang=EN>
<P dir=ltr align=left>What may seem to be serious science to some is fun to others and both fun and science will be on display later this month at the fifth-annual OTC Community Day on April 26.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Jared Durden, an adjunct physics instructor at OTC, and other science students will be demonstrating their homemade hovercraft and a second hovering device at the event, in an effort, Duren said, to bring science to the community.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>The hovercraft, in the shape of a disc and equipped with a seat and unicorn head, operates with a two-horsepower shop vac motor that can lift more than 200 pounds.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>The second device that will be demonstrated uses leaf blower motors to lift someone off the ground.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"We are creating interactive science displays and fun toys to be displayed in public forums to promote a science-based discourse out in the community," said Durden, who started his post-secondary education at OTC.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"Not everyone is a scientist and this gives the community a chance to see science in action instead of just in theory. Its a way to get people interested in science and draw in non-science people."</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>The demonstrations will be among many other programs that will be on display during the event, which will be held at the OTC Springfield Campus from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>A 5K run/walk will kickoff this years event at 8 a.m. at the Springfield campus. There will also be a non-timed, 1-mile fun walk in addition to the 5K.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>The cost of the run is $25 for adults and $20 for students. Late registration will be from 7-7:30 a.m. on race day. To register for the race, go to </SPAN><A href="http://www.otc.edu/communityday/5krun.php"><SPAN lang="">http://www.otc.edu/communityday/5krun.php</SPAN></A></P><SPAN lang=EN>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>The annual car show and welding repair day will also be part of the day. </P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Anyone in need of welding repairs can bring it to the College, 1001 E. Chestnut Expressway, and for a $10 donation, have the work done. The Breast Cancer Foundation of the Ozarks will receive the collected donations.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>The annual plant sale and car show will take place as well.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>

<p class="MsoNormal">Michelle Howard might be seeing mannequins in her sleep.</p>
<p>OTC&rsquo;s director of the college&rsquo;s simulation center has been working for a year to assemble a state-of-the-art medical simulation center for use by college students and private agencies in educating students and training medical personnel in various emergency medical scenarios.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been exciting and it&rsquo;s picking up. The community will be able to tap into it. The faculty are getting into it,&rdquo; said Howard, who was a practical nurse instructor before taking the director&rsquo;s position last year.</p>
<p>The center is home to a number of electronically elaborate mannequins that can mimic myriad medical conditions that test the skills and abilities of emergency personnel. Each adult mannequin costs about $113,000. Pediatric mannequins cost less.</p>
<p>The devices are computer-driven and can bleed, sweat, speak and move. They can produce symptoms of everything from a heart attack to a drug overdose to a concussion.</p>
<p>The current program is being funded through a state Training for Tomorrow grant but Howard hopes to someday have a $1.25 million fully operational four-room simulation center constructed in Lincoln Hall that would include a labor room and a surgical room.</p>
<p>Howard said there are advantages for the student in having such a center.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Students can apply their classroom knowledge in a safe, learning environment and we can critically evaluate their skills without putting anyone in danger. We can put them in scenarios that they may never see but at least they will be exposed to it,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The community also is making use of the mannequins.</p>
<p>Cox Hospitals' emergency personnel use them as part of their recertification training and the Missouri National Guard has contacted Howard about using the devices to train its folks in battlefield medical treatment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the community, the center will give healthcare professionals a chance to refine and enhance their skills. It shows the community we care about a student would will graduate with a well-rounded education,&rdquo; Howard said.</p>

                    <p>The newly accredited Associate of Arts in Teaching degree has resulted in hundreds of students coming to Ozarks Technical Community College to complete their first two years of study to prepare for a career in teaching.</p>
<p>This semester, there are 800 students enrolled in the program, which was accredited in 2009.</p>
<p>All 12 community college are offering the degree, which transfers to any state four-year university without any loss of credit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This statewide degree is a very unique program in the nation. Just the fact that 12 community colleges have come together and agree on one degree is remarkable,&rdquo; said Linda Caldwell, department chair for the education program at OTC.</p>
<p>Angie Miller, coordinator of teacher education at OTC, said the large number of students in the program is due partially to the increasing number of high schools participating in the A+ program, which pays the students&rsquo; tuition and also requires the student to tutor at a local school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite often, students share that a major reason why they think they want to enter the teaching profession is due to the hours spent as a tutor at an elementary or secondary school,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Shirley Lawler, associate vice president of academic affairs, said accrediting the program has had a positive impact on attracting potential teachers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love working with future teachers,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They are excellent students who have been positively influenced by a teacher in their past and now they want to give something back to younger students.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>Ozarks Technical Community College&rsquo;s Center for Workforce Development is ready to offer a new training option for those wanting to enter the healthcare field.</p>
<p>A new hybrid Certified Nurse Assistant course has been approved by the Missouri Department of Health and Human Services and will be offered as an online course beginning the week of June 20.</p>
<p>The 75-hour course will include 50 hours of online instruction and 25 hours of seated classes for testing and meeting with other students and instructors. Students also will be required to complete 100 hours of clinical work at a long-term care facility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is an excellent opportunity for students who have other commitments and cannot attend two full days of class per week or for those who are working and want to move to a new career, but cannot take time off without pay to become certified,&rdquo; said Dana Thorp Patterson, assistant executive director of the OTC Community Enrichment Center.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best part is they still get the OTC quality of education in a new cutting-edge format.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Students will receive the same materials and support as what a seated class offers. &nbsp;Students working at a long-term facility can use the hours worked there towards their clinical requirements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Students work on assignments independently and at their convenience.&nbsp; This saves drive time and travel expense, and in the current economy, we think it&rsquo;s just what students need and want,&rdquo; Patterson said.</p>
<p>Faith Mann, a registered nurse and the course&rsquo;s lead instructor, said the class was developed at the request of students.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a lot of inquiries from current students who were taking a full load of seated classes and needed the certification in order to work,&rdquo; Mann said.</p>
<p>After six months of work experience, new CNAs can return to the workforce center to become Certified Medication Technicians, allowing them to dispense medications to patients in long-term facilities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will open up opportunities for nurse assistants everywhere in the state since it&rsquo;s an online course,&rdquo; Mann said.</p>
<p>For more information or to register, call 447-8888 or go to www.otc.edu/workforce.</p>

		<title>Hybrid courses at Richwood gives student options</title>

                    <p>The new hybrid courses being offering at the OTC-Richwood Valley campus came at just the right time for Christina Polosky of Springfield.</p>
<p>Polosky, who is studying to become a teacher, was looking for a more convenient way to take a number of education courses and not spend too many long days at Richwood Valley, her campus of preference.</p>
<p>Polosky was intrigued with the hybrid offerings that allow students to take classes online and also get the face-to-face time with instructors. That&rsquo;s exactly what the new courses, being offered for the first time this fall, will provide Polosky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the best of both worlds,&rdquo; Polosky said. &ldquo;I can come to campus one day a week to see the instructor and others in the class. How wonderful is that? I like the face-to-face part of class. I like discussing things in person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Polosky will be taking to education classes and one mathematics class in the fall. She said she would have taken more if more hybrid classes had been available.</p>
<p>Fridays at Richwood Valley will be dedicated to the hybrid classes that require one day of on-site instruction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reducing the on-campus time to a single day will allow students in the hybrid courses to maintain their work, family and other obligations throughout the week, as well as to reduce their transportation costs,&rdquo; said Jeff Jochems, president of the OTC Richwood Valley Campus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;At the same time, it provides a balance for those students who benefit from in-person time with their instructor and collaboration with their classmates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matt Harris, college director of OTC Online, said the hybrid courses at Richwood Valley offer students an option for those who want the traditional classroom environment while maintaining a job the rest of the week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hybrid courses effectively combine the flexible schedule of online courses with the face-to-face interaction of the seated classroom experience,&rdquo; Harris said.</p>
<p>Polosky, who plans to graduate with an associate of arts in teaching and go on to a four-year college to earn her bachelor&rsquo;s degree, said she is looking forward to the convenience the hybrid courses offer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been telling everyone I can that I&rsquo;m doing this. I think it&rsquo;s going to be a good experience,&rdquo; she said.</p>

		<title>IMT degree drawings lots of interest</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
                    
                    <P>Ozarks Technical Community College's Landon Vinson has said that the Industrial Maintenance Technology degree could be referred to as the "unknown degree," but OTC's full-time IMT instructor is letting anyone who will listen know about its profitable advantages.</P>
<P>"There's going to be a huge demand for these graduates in the workforce," said Vinson. "Big companies in town are coming to OTC and looking for graduates to update their workforce. They want us to train their future employees."</P>
<P>People who don't know about the program think the degree teaches you how to clean up the grease and grime in manufacturing settings and believe the pay is pitiful.</P>
<P>Both assumptions couldnt be further from the truth.</P>
<P>The jobs offered to IMT graduates vary from production management to quality control. And the pay for some of those jobs is among the highest for associate degree earners. In this region, salaries range from a low of $33,000 to as much as $70,000.</P>
<P>Recent graduates have gotten jobs at BNSF Railroad, CoxHealth and 3M.</P>
<P>Vinson knows what hes talking about when it comes to the program. He graduated from OTC with an IMT degree in 2011 and worked at Springfield Remanufacturing Corporation before coming to OTC this semester to become the full-time IMT instructor.</P>
<P>Vinson said demand for IMT graduates will increase over the years.</P>
<P>"For many years, companies relied on those with a farming background for experience in fixing things. Those people are retiring and the equipment is more technologically advanced. Theres a lot more automation and troubleshooting involved. Old machines are being replaced with new ones," he said.</P>
<P>Vinson, an Ava native, came to OTC to earn an automotive degree but found he didn't like it and switched to IMT, in part because of his father.</P>
<P>"My dad was a mechanic so I gravitated to the mechanical side. I was interested in industrial problem-solving," he said. "The opportunities were larger. I was able to get into all kinds of stuff."</P>
<P>Earlier this year, Vinson jumped at the chance to teach at his alma mater. </P>
<P>"Teaching was always my target. I was thinking about it closer to retirement age, but when it came up, it seemed like the right time for me," he said. "It's a continuous challenge, but a perfect one for me."</P><I>

                    <P>For Dillon Welch, representing Ozarks Technical Community College in the national SkillsUSA competition in Kansas City was too important of an event to miss.</P>
<P>So even when he sustained a serious leg injury in a motorcycle accident about two weeks before the competition, Dillon made it to the event &nbsp;in a wheelchair.</P>
<P>"They put in the work like I did. I didn't want to ruin it for my teammates. It was the least I could do," said the 20-year-old studying construction management at OTC.</P>
<P>Dillon broke both lower bones in his left leg, broke his ankle, dislocated his foot and tore all the tendons in his left when he jumped from his motorcycle at 50 mph as the machine started to fall back on him while he was trying to ride on just the back wheel. </P>
<P>A total of 30 pins were implanted in his leg and he will not be able to walk for three months.</P>
<P>"I thought about the skills competition while I was in the hospital. I wanted the team to find someone else but the team didnt want to," he said.</P>
<P>Dillon assisted his teammates as best he could, moving around the indoor construction site as the team built a small version of a house that required everything from framing to masonry work to plumbing.</P>
<P>The Cassville High School graduate did what he could while seated in a wheelchair. With his tool belt strapped to the back of his wheelchair, Dillon did some framing, insulation, caulking and cleanup.</P>
<P>"It was a tight area. There were a lot of obstacles and I didn't practice ahead of time working from a wheelchair," he said.</P>
<P>The team finished 12th in the nation, a good finish considering the situation.</P>

<P>"<SPAN lang=EN>I am very proud of all of SkillsUSA national competitors. Many of them overcame health issues and challenges to compete this year," said Cynthia Phillips, SkillsUSA lead advisor at OTC.</P>

<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"Dillon Welch is an excellent example of leadership and that level of dedication. His team was thrilled to compete and look after Dillon so they could represent OTC in an exemplary manner. They are all champions in my book."</P></SPAN>

                    <P>OTC instructor James Sheldon went out of his way recently to emphasize "long" in the term long-distance learning when he conducted a class from the Bahamas last week with his students who were sitting in a science lab at the Richwood Valley campus.</P>
<P>Shelton, who teaches environmental science and biology, was in the Bahamas earning his SCUBA diving certification and planned to hold a class from the ocean setting.</P>
<P>Students were in the classroom waiting to see and hear Shelton via SKYPE, but the video portion of the connection failed to work so Shelton conducted an audio-only lecture for his class.</P>
<P>Shelton was located in the area of the Bahamas where a number of James Bond movies were set, including "Casino Royale" starring Daniel Craig.</P>
<P>"The water is a crystal blue color and then if you go out 300 feet, it turns dark blue and is inhabited by sharks," he told the class.</P>
<P>Shelton described some of vegetation and animal life in the waters. He spotted a lion fish and a spiny starfish during his dives.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Before heading out on his trip, Shelton said he has always been around water.</P>
<P>"I always dived and snorkeled. I was a big fan of 'Sea Hunt' (a TV series based on a SCUBA diver). Ive always been interested," he said.</P>
<P>Shelton got approval for the long-distance lecture from school administrators and students, who were excited by the idea.</P>
<P>"The students were enthusiastically on board with this. It was absolutely serendipitous that the lecture I had scheduled the day I was gone was about the oceanic environment," he said.</P>
<P>Shelton called the science lab at class time. Lab assistant Kelli Cole monitored the phone, took questions from students and passed them on to Shelton.</P>
<P>Shelton said he was amazed at the narrow streets, the beat up conditions of taxis and the traffic control devices that were used on the islands.</P>
<P>"There are no stop signs. You give way instead of stopping. There are no intersections. Everything is a roundabout," he said. </P>
<P>But the question one student asked seemed to be most on their minds.</P>
<P>"Are you bringing back any souvenirs?" a student asked.</P>
<P>"Yes," Shelton said.</P><I>

<p class="MsoNormal">Tiffany Archer spent hours as a child building skyscrapers with Legos.</p>
<p>Today, Archer continues to use plastic building blocks in her classroom as an instructor in the Computer Information Systems department at Ozarks Technical Community College.</p>
<p>Only, the classroom version of Legos comes to life with software that make the finished products move and respond to their surroundings.</p>
<p>Archer, who teaches computer programming at OTC, has been using the Lego robot kits in a class for two years. The class is specifically designed to teach students how to program the miniature machines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Legos have a nice appeal to students, many of whom, like me, played with them as a child. While the students learn programming in other classes, this class teaches them to program differently by programming robots,&rdquo; Archer said.</p>
<p>Archer said what the students learn in the classroom about programming robots is directly applicable to what&rsquo;s taking place in manufacturing today.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Manufacturing isn&rsquo;t going to change. There is more and more automation taking over. It will not shift back to humans,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The robots used in the classroom can be made into dogs, spiders and a machine with a claw. Archer&rsquo;s most recent robot is a dog named George.</p>
<p>George, with his orange eyes and long, gray Lego ears, can be run with a remote tethered to him or without the leash. He scoots across the floor until he hears Archer&rsquo;s voice, stops and turns toward the sound. A second later, he is at her feet waiting for her voice to speak again.</p>
<p>The robots can also be programmed to follow a certain path or to stop when they come to the edge of a table to avoid falling off.</p>
<p>The robots are great recruiting tools at high school fairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They really spark the younger students who have played with Legos as a child,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">OTC faculty members Jim Bridwell (left) and Terry Pridgeon are looking forward to this year&rsquo;s Community Day event for very different reasons.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For Bridwell, an instructor in Welding Technology, it means offering welding repairs to the community in exchange for a donation to the March of Dimes. Over the past three years, the event has raised more than $3,000 for the local charity chapter.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For Pridgeon, just being involved in another OTC Car and Motorcycle Show is a big step from where he was over the Christmas holiday when doctors removed a cancerous kidney.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know if I was going to see another car show,&rdquo; said the automotive refinishing instructor.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Bridwell and Pridgeon will be on hand April 28 for the third-annual Community Day that runs from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. on the corner of National Avenue and Chestnut Expressway.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In addition to the car show and community welding day, the free event will offer a plant sale, various health screenings, live music, a kids&rsquo; zone, lawn-mower blade sharpening, robot demonstrations and the Springfield-Greene County Mobile Library, among other things.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Bridwell, who has been at OTC full-time since 1999, said the welding day began contributing to March of Dimes after a motorcycle club he belonged to started giving money to the local charity. After no fundraiser was held one year, Bridwell decided to help by using welding day as a way to raise money for the charity.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll repair everything from lawn ornaments to baker&rsquo;s racks to putting the legs back on those flamingos,&rdquo; Bridwell said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Pridgeon, 51, who has been at OTC six years, will find special meaning in this year&rsquo;s event as he recovers from his surgery.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">During winter break in December, Pridgeon said he wasn&rsquo;t feeling good when he went to the doctor. He was diagnosed with kidney cancer and one was removed two days after Christmas.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;The prognosis is good. Everything looks a little brighter. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for family and friends, I don&rsquo;t know where I&rsquo;d be,&rdquo; Pridgeon said.</p>

		<title>International students find OTC is a good home for them</title>

                    <P>While community colleges are primarily for local residents to use to enhance their education, more and more international students are enrolling.</P>
<P>"I knew Missouri State had a lot of international students but OTC was a better economic choice for me," said Daniel Lee, a South Korean who grew up in Lamar.</P>
<P>Lee and about 40 other international students will attend OTC classes in the fall. Loren Lundstrom, director of international programs, said a large number of countries are represented at OTC, including students from Peru and Canada to Russia and Singapore.</P>
<P>"We are gaining students from countries we never had before including the Ukraine, Sweden and Finland," Lundstrom said. </P>
<P>International students must meet a number of requirements in order to be issued a visa to study, including showing having graduated from a school equivalent to a U.S. high school. Academic records are checked. Tuition is higher for international students.</P>
<P>But unlike in the past when only children of rich families could come to the U.S. for their education, Lundstrom said middle class families are sending their children to get an education.</P>
<P>"Higher education is available to the middle class all over the world," he said. "Most of our students come here because of family relations. Someone from their family is already here. There is a boyfriend following his girlfriend."</P>
<P>For Daniel, his family came to the U.S. a few years ago because his uncle operated a business and his father brought the family from Seoul to run the family business.</P>
<P>Daniel, who is studying occupational therapy at OTC, isn't sure what field of medicine he wants to student after he earns his degree. He has enjoyed his time at OTC and talks to other international students about it.</P>
<P>"People come up to me and ask me about their education and where they need to go," he said. </P>
<P>"I always recommend they go to OTC first and then go to a four-year college. OTC is the kind of school that you get our what you put in. With hard work, you'll be happy with the results."</P>

                    <P>OTC students have game. </P>
<P>Students from the Lebanon and Waynesville centers have formed intramural basketball teams that square off&nbsp;in weekend games.</P>
<P>The idea for the league came from two students, Blaire Wade at the Lebanon Center and Marcus Gamble at the Waynesville Center.</P>
<P>"Marcus contacted the Student Government Association in Lebanon and asked if we were interested in playing basketball," said Wade, who played high school basketball at Stoutland and is the only woman playing in the league. </P>
<P>"I love basketball. I really wanted to do it. Marcus and I had conference calls on where to have the games and it was on from there.</P>
<P>There are two teams made up mostly of former high school players, except for Gamble, who played several years of college basketball at Missouri Valley College.</P>
<P>The two teams met for the first time at the YMCA in Lebanon, which provides a referee and use of the scoreboard.</P>
<P>"It's exciting and I'm excited," said Rosalind Pride, director of the Waynesville Center. "It's been two years that we've been trying to start this. Marcus and Blaire made it happened. It's not every day you get a group of guys to travel 30 miles to play an intramural game. It says we've got spirit."</P>
<P>Isaac Gillen, who played basketball at Lebanon High School for four years, is a member of the Lebanon Center team.</P>
<P>"It's fun. It's kind of like a real college with intramurals," he said. "Hopefully, we'll do better against Waynesville than we did in high school."</P>
<P>The Lebanon Center team beat Waynesville on Saturday.</P>
<P>Wade would like to see teams formed at the other campuses and centers in the OTC system.</P>
<P>"We're challenging Springfield, Richwood Valley and table Rock to form teams. We hope they can come in and defeat them as well," she said.</P>
<P>Wade said having the league and playing gives students a sense of pride.</P>
<P>"They just don't want to go to college," she said. "They want to go to a place where theyre involved in something. This is a place where they can do that. It's a great way to get people connected and make friendships."</P>

                    <SPAN lang=EN>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Kat Allie, department chair of fine arts and humanities at Ozarks Technical Community College, didn't take art classes growing up but today, she's using her skills as an artist to teach others.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Her abilities as an encaustic artist are featured this month in the Missouri Arts Councils magazine.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"I am honored to be one of the featured artists for encaustic painters in this state," she said. "I'm really proud of the shout out that the Springfield Regional Arts Council gets in the article. To highlight that organization is amazing."</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>According to the article by Barbara MacRobie, encaustic art is in its simplest form, encaustic paint is melted wax with added pigment. The artist brushes the hot paint onto a porous surface like a wooden board, then adds more wax layer by layer, reheating each layer to fuse it to the one below it.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"You paint while the wax is hot," Allie said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Allie is not only quoted in the story but the second half of the article is dedicated to Allie demonstrating the technique in text and photos.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>One of her works, "Kiss It Better I," is pictured in the magazine.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"This shadowbox is about loving, healing, and my young daughter. Let me kiss it better and Ill put the Band-Aid on it," Allie says in the article.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Allie became interested in the encaustic technique about 14 years after attending an encaustic workshop in Santa Fe. </P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"I did that and I was hooked," she said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>The unique technique is time consuming. While Allie has to work quickly while the wax is hot and fluid, building layer upon layer takes time. It can take up to eight hours to make the paint she need.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Not a lot of artists use the encaustic technique. </P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"You have to be committed to the work," she said. "It's hard, physical work. You have to love it to get committed to doing it. I love feeling the heat coming up from the surfaces. I can create so many different textures."</P>

                    <!-- @font-face {   font-family: "Cambria"; }p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal { margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: "Times New Roman"; }a:link, span.MsoHyperlink { color: blue; text-decoration: underline; }a:visited, span.MsoHyperlinkFollowed { color: purple; text-decoration: underline; }div.Section1 { page: Section1; } -->
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The list of classes offered this spring and summer at the Community Enrichment Center&rsquo;s Kids&rsquo; College covers a variety of subjects, ranging from video game design to cooking to etiquette class.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Kids College is full of enrichment opportunities for children ages 3 to 15 and include exploration of science, computers and foreign language and culture,&rdquo; said Dana Thorp-Patterson, assistant executive director of the center.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;Registration is on now for some of the classes that start over the next month while some summer offerings are still being developed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;Spring courses include &ldquo;Creepy Crawly Ecology: Birds &amp; Beasts,&rdquo; a class on making cookies, brownies and muffins, Irish Celtic dance instruction and classes in both archery and golf.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;While most of the classes are designed with the single student in mind, some of the classes pair the student with an important adult in their life.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;It allows the student to share the learning experience with a parent, grandparent or other significant adult in their life. These include cooking together, cake decorating and even family sign language,&rdquo; Patterson said. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;In addition, if an adult takes a foreign language class, they may also enroll their children ages 12 and up to take the class with them - the assumption is that learning the language together creates bonds as well as an opportunity to use what they learn.&rdquo;<br /> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The annual summer camp for kids will be held again this year and includes classes in cooking, sign language, art, and woodworking and ends in the creation of a giant, 20-foot banana split for the campers and their guests on their final day of camp.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Some of the upcoming summer courses include:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&bull; Painting for preschoolers</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&bull; Printmaking class</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&bull; A study of the Middle Ages</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&bull; A study of Native American and South American crafts and culture</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&bull; Childcare training for tweens and teens on babysitting that includes a CPR class</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&bull; A three-day computer camp for kids to learn all about computers</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&bull; A one-day weather workshop to learn how to forecast the weather</span></p>

		<title>Lebanon Education Center grows despite tough times</title>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;The Lebanon Education Center of Ozarks Technical Community College continues to grow during the region&rsquo;s tight-economic times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Enrollment this fall is up nearly 15 percent with 462 students taking classes at the center, located at 533 W. Bland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Everyone is looking for a good value. &nbsp;OTC provides a good educational value. &nbsp;With very competitive tuition coupled with high quality education, OTC is poised to attract students,&rdquo; said John Greer, coordinator of the Lebanon center.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Traditional students are more concerned about staying close to home in order to save money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Economic conditions in Laclede County have brought displaced workers to the Lebanon center to look for new career and retraining opportunities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Many employers in Lebanon have laid workers off and that gives them an excellent opportunity to use this time to expand skills or retrain for new skills,&rdquo; Greer said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Dr. Sue Moore, OTC&rsquo;s dean of Extended Campuses and College Outreach, said unemployed workers want more training.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;There is an increasing demand for education and workforce training due to the dire economic situation in some of the communities.&nbsp; More people are seeing the need to further their education due to the knowledge and skills required to use the latest technologies in their jobs.&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;If residents can attend college locally, limit spending on transportation, and still have the time to work and care for their families, they are more likely to seek and accomplish their educational goals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Overall, enrollment at OTC&rsquo;s two campuses and three education centers is up nearly 16 percent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As we have continued to grow as an institution, our student population has also grown, and we are working hard to meet the needs of each student,&rdquo; said Dr. Hal Higdon, president of the College.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;However, with state funding continuing to diminish, there is little we can do to alleviate our physical capacity issues, particularly at the Springfield campus.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>By Steve Koehler</p>
<p>The latest state-of-the-art medical mannequin is helping Allied Health students at Ozarks Technical Community College prepare for the real thing &mdash;&nbsp;helping human beings.</p>
<p>The newest mannequin, known as the Sim Man 3G, is being used by Nursing, Respiratory Therapy and Paramedic programs to help students improve their techniques in everything from patient assessment to emergency treatment before working with real patients. It brings to three the number of mannequins the college has for health training.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since the human patient simulator can demonstrate a wide variety of conditions, the Sim Man could be a patient with a nervous system disorder such as epilepsy or meningitis, a cardiac patient with chest pain or hypertension, a pulmonary patient with chronic bronchitis or pneumonia,&rdquo; said Stephen Bishop, dean of the Allied Health program.</p>
<p>The mannequin, which can produce blood, sweat and tears, can be programmed to present cases that range from fairly straightforward for beginning students to much more complicated health issues for our advanced students.</p>
<p>In addition, staff and other students can role-play the parts of family members and other healthcare personnel to make the situations more realistic for the students.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A simulation scenario allows for dealing with family, physicians and others in as realistic of an environment as possible. At the end of each scenario, students are debriefed about their experience,&rdquo; said Michelle Howard, Simulations Lab Coordinator.</p>
<p>Bishop said using the mannequin allows instructors to adjust the difficulty level for students to improve their critical-thinking skills, give students a wide range of patient care situations and give students extremely realistic practice in a safe environment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emergency or critical situations are very stressful and the patient is the primary concern, so sometimes students get shuffled over to the side of the room while the other health professionals handle the situation,&rdquo; Bishop said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the simulated environment, the students are in the middle of the stressful situation and must decide how to deal with it themselves. &nbsp;If they make a mistake, they can see the actual consequences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next week, Howard will begin looking at other simulation labs at various community colleges and universities to find ways to incorporate a simulation lab for surgical tech, dental, occupational therapy and physical therapy programs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Few schools in either the state or nationally utilize simulation with multidisciplinary programs like we are doing at OTC. We are working to be on the cutting edge with the new lab,&rdquo; Howard said.</p>

                    <p>Seth and Britney Hartsell have been together ever since they first met at Hillcrest High School in 2008.</p>
<p>So, it wasn&rsquo;t much of surprise when the Hartsells received their nursing pins together after graduating last month from the OTC Practical Nursing program, the first married couple to be pinned at the same time.</p>
<p>The two enrolled in the nursing program thanks to a medical incident involved Britney in 2009.</p>
<p>Britney had to undergo an appendectomy in 2009 at Cox South Hospital. The couple was so impressed by the care she received, they decided to join the nursing ranks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The care we received by the nursing staff was what drew us to nursing,&rdquo; Seth said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;It was a decision the couple is glad they made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a good fit for us. It was something we really wanted to do,&rdquo; Seth said.</p>
<p>Seth and Britney said they appreciated being able to attend classes together a lot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was nice to have a study buddy. We got to see each other a lot, &ldquo; said Britney said.</p>
<p>While they both work at the Burrell Behavioral Center, they are planning to go their separate ways when it comes to furthering their careers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t expect to work together in the future,&rdquo; Seth said.</p>
<p>In fact, nursing will be a stepping stone in what the Springfield couple eventually wants to do.</p>
<p>Seth is planning to study bioengineering and Britney is currently studying psychology at Missouri State University. She hopes to combine social work with her nursing skills.</p>
<p>Seth also works as a nurse at the Greene County Jail. He would like to resume his studies after Britney graduates from MSU.</p>
<p>The couple said the Practical Nursing program was extremely challenging but at the same time, rewarding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an excellent program with really good instructors. We had great access to all the items we needed. It was a great experience,&rdquo; Britney said.</p>

		<title>Married couple of 63 years to see 'Our Town' performance</title>

                    <p>When Joe Senn was a kid growing up in Phillipsburg, he would come to the Gillioz Theater to see a movie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to the Gillioz was like going to a palace,&rdquo; Joe said.</p>
<p>That was 75 years ago.</p>
<p>Now, at age 86, he and his wife, Hazel, who have been married 63 years, will be special guests at the May 1 matinee performance of &ldquo;Our Town,&rdquo; presented by the Ozarks Technical Community College&rsquo;s Theater department.</p>
<p>The day will be extra special for Hazel for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>She will turn 83 a few days before the performance. And, when she attends the play, it will mark the first time Hazel has ever been inside the grand structure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m more excited about, seeing the play or seeing the Gillioz,&rdquo; Hazel said.</p>
<p>Joe said he&rsquo;s thrilled his wife will see the ornate building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will have the pleasure of taking her to the beautiful Gillioz as a special birthday present,&rdquo; Joe said.</p>
<p>The couple has lived in Springfield for 17 years, after living 47 years in Thayer, where Joe operated a Ben Franklin store. Hazel served as the first school nurse in Thayer.</p>
<p>As a boy, Joe would get to travel the 50 miles with the family to Springfield to see the latest movie at the Gillioz.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was magnificent. You could stand on the steps and see into the lobby. Being on the square was a big deal. I took my first elevator ride in the Heers Department store,&rdquo; Joe said.</p>
<p>The couple met when Hazel&rsquo;s aunt brought her into Joe&rsquo;s store on the pretense of needing a spool of thread. But as they look back now, the couple said it was all planned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She had it all setup. I don&rsquo;t know if we ever got that spool of thread,&rdquo; Hazel said.</p>
<p>While Hazel was in Memphis at nursing school, Joe built her a house to convince her he was the one to marry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted to show her she couldn&rsquo;t say no,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Tickets are still available for the play. Performances are April 29 and 30 at 7:30 p.m., May 1 at 2:30 p.m. and May 7 at 7:30 p.m. Call the Gillioz Theatre for tickets: 863-9491.</p>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Ozarks Technical Community College&rsquo;s innovative Middle College program will begin its second year with 43 Springfield high school students to provide a new career pathway for the students to consider.</p>
<p>The program, the only one of its kind in the state, was developed to lower the Springfield school district&rsquo;s high-school dropout rate by targeting underachieving students who have the potential to excel and give the students an opportunity to prepare themselves for a post-graduation life.</p>
<p>Students take classes to complete their high-school education along while completing college courses. They will also work an internship at a selected business. The program stresses personal responsibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;The program is designed for students who are behind in school or have life circumstances whereby the traditional high school is not as suitable.&nbsp; These are bright kids and through assessment have demonstrated a high potential to do college level work.&nbsp; We will provide them with a lot of resources on campus to give them a leg up, but we will also insist they step up their own expectations for learning,&rdquo; said Dr. LaRaine Bauer, OTC&rsquo;s Middle College coordinator.</p>
<p>Funding for the program comes from the Missouri Department of Economic Development, the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education and the Community Foundation of the Ozarks.</p>
<p>Of the 43 students, 16 percent are minorities and 76 percent are first-generation college students.</p>
<p>The new pathway, Medical Services, joins the two other career pathways, Early Childhood Development and Diesel/Automotive Technology.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This expansion is consistent with the needs of our community since healthcare is the No. 1 employer in the Springfield metro area. Our students will focus on health-related courses in medical terminology, which will assist them in understanding the language of medicine and healthcare occupations,&rdquo; Bauer said.</p>
<p>This spring, 28 of the 32 students who enrolled completed the semester.</p>
<p>Next spring, the Middle College will hold is first graduation ceremony at the Gillioz Theater.</p>

		<title>Middle College bench project a big hit</title>

                    <P>At first glance, a simple park bench doesn't appear to be much of a symbol for taking a stand on world issues.</P>
<P>But a final project by this spring's students at OTC's Middle College did just that - transforming a wooden bench into statements on local and world issues.</P>
<P>This spring, students in the Middle College program created benches from scratch that carried messages ranging from hunger to water quality to diversity.</P>
<P>The students' work recently was unveiled at a luncheon and the benches were donated to various groups to put on display. </P>
<P>"When other students at the end of the school year are often&nbsp;disengaged in relevant learning, the Middle College staff developed a creative, cross-curricular six-day unit that focused on the impact people can have when they get involved in important local or global issues," said LaRaine Bauer, dean of special academic programs who oversees the Middle College program.</P>
<P>The themes and bench recipients were:</P>
<P>World Hunger Bench: Ozark Food Harvest</P>
<P>Water Bench:&nbsp; Watershed Committee Center</P>
<P>Deforestation Bench:&nbsp; Botanical Center at Nathanael Greene Park</P>
<P></P>
<P>Equality Bench:&nbsp; Rare Breed Youth Outreach Center</P>
<P>Anti-Bullying Bench:&nbsp; Robberson Elementary</P>
<P>"To know that the students in Middle College were aware of the botanical center and thought of us as a worthy ambassador for helping to carry the message to 'stop deforestation' is humbling," said Katie Steinhoff, Botanical Center Coordinator for Springfield-Greene County Parks.</P>
<P>The students designed, built and created the messages on the benches. In addition, another group of students documented the work with pictures and video that was shown as a recent presentation.</P>
<P>"Social change is a difficult concept for a student to wrap their mind around at the young age of 16 or 17 years of age, but our juniors in Middle College spent a week examining social issues, identifying a problem and highlighting it by building benches," Bauer said.</P>
<P>"Each bench had a special message painted on the bench as a billboard to make others stop and think when they rested a few moments on our bench."</P>

		<title>Middle College instructor honored for reading program</title>

                    <div class="pr_imagewrapper">/Sandra_Pierce.jpg</div>
                    <p>Sandra Pierce knew that offering a reading course to students immersed in a world of technological gadgetry would be a challenge.</p>
<p>But the OTC Middle College instructor took the challenge head on, and as a result, she was awarded a Turner Reading Award last month from the Springfield Public Schools Foundation for her excellence in teaching reading to Middle College students.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about student choice and student responsibility. They choose the books; they form the reading circles. The responsibility is on them,&rdquo; said Pierce, who has been with the Middle College since its start in 2008.</p>
<p>OTC Middle College is a contemporary, academic pathway for underperforming students who are struggling within the limitations of traditional high school and may be ready for a more mature environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The students read five books a semester, and in addition to reading the books, they conduct weekly discussion groups, keep journals about the book, and highlight important things that happen in it.</p>
<p>The program began with a $3,000 grant to buy books for high school students to read. The award that Pierce won is worth $1,000, which Pierce said she would put toward buying more books that the students choose to read.</p>
<p>LaRaine Bauer, OTC Middle College director, said Pierce has been dedicated to increasing the reading time of students who are reluctant to do so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandy&rsquo;s creative ways to encourage reluctant readers are a specialty for her.&nbsp; Sandy sets the bar high, and she is firm with her expectations.&nbsp; Rarely is there a student that leaves her classroom that doesn't say,&nbsp;&lsquo;I learned a lot from Ms. Pierce,&rsquo;&rdquo; Bauer said.</p>
<p>Pierce said the success of the class shows that in a world where young adults are preoccupied with smartphones, texting, Twittering and Facebook, time can be found for simply reading.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I start to see students who are passionate about reading by the time they finish. I&rsquo;ve had students tell me the book they read in class is the first one they&rsquo;ve read cover to cover. I don&rsquo;t think they realize that they are becoming lifelong readers as a result of the class,&rdquo; she said.</p>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>Ozarks Technical Community College&rsquo;s Middle College program is not only providing a venue for high school students to gain a foot up on their educational future but it&rsquo;s also giving people a reason to smile.</p>
<p>Victor Stewart, a Middle College student studying Early Childhood Development, is smiling after winning a Missouri Breaking Traditions Award and scholarship in April.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t sure about the program at first but now, I love it. You learn a lot about college life,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Shelly Ramos and her son, Dylan, are smiling after he was accepted into the program for next fall and will be studying diesel/automotive technology.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This program is right up his alley. It&rsquo;s what he wants to do. He&rsquo;s been focused in this field,&rdquo; Dylan&rsquo;s mom said.</p>
<p>OTC&rsquo;s innovative Middle College program was started last fall to help with Springfield R-12 school district&rsquo;s high-school dropout rate, target underachieving students who have the potential to excel and give the students an opportunity to prepare themselves for a post-graduation life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The program is designed for students who are behind in school or have life circumstances whereby the traditional high school is not as suitable.&nbsp; These are bright kids and through assessment have demonstrated a high potential to do college level work.&nbsp; We will provide them with a lot of resources on campus to give them a leg up, but we will also insist they step up their own expectations for learning,&rdquo; said Dr. LaRaine Bauer, OTC&rsquo;s Middle College coordinator.</p>
<p>While the Middle College is designed to assist students that are struggling in high school, this program also helps address the needs of students that are historically underserved or lack access to higher education.</p>
<p>This past year, the program offered two career pathways, Early Childhood Development or Diesel/Automotive Technology. This fall, a medical services program will be offered as a third choice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This expansion is consistent with the needs of our community since healthcare is the No. 1 employer in the Springfield metro area. Our students will focus on health-related courses in medical terminology, which will assist them in understanding the language of medicine and healthcare occupations,&rdquo; Bauer said.</p>
<p>There are 48 students enrolled in the fall courses with 16 in each of the three programs.</p>
<p>Students take classes to complete their high-school education along with earning free college credit. They will also work an internship at a selected business.</p>
<p>Bauer said because the program is so innovative, other community colleges are beginning to call her office for information.</p>
<p>Stewart, 17, from Central High School, said he entered the Early Childhood program because of his love for kids.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I heard I could work with kids, I knew I wanted to be in the program,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Stewart won the state award for being a student in a nontraditional career or technical education program.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope to have a career combining my work with children and music,&rdquo; said Stewart, who won a two-year scholarship to OTC with the award.</p>
<p>Crystal Swisher, 16, served as a role model for her 15-year-old sister, Amber Powers, when it comes to Middle College.</p>
<p>Crystal is in the program and Amber will be join her in the fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw how Crystal was improving in her grades. It&rsquo;s more relaxed here. I think I&rsquo;m ready to do it,&rdquo; Amber said.</p>
<p>Bauer said two-thirds of the 28 students in the first year of the program improved their high-school grade point averages&nbsp;and 25 of the 28 students who completed their college courses earned all five college credit hours that were available.</p>
<p>A total of 21 students participated in various internships throughout Springfield with business partners such as, O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s Automotive, Central State Core Supply, City Utilities Service Fleet Center, Broadway Headstart, Isabelle&rsquo;s House and Joyland Daycare .</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I am really happy our students now have more choices and can take greater ownership of their learning experiences through the Middle College.&nbsp;We are the hook for some students to keep them in school and help them become more actively engaged in learning as well as ease the transition to college life,&rdquo; Bauer said.</p>

                    <p>The overwhelmingly successful Middle College at Ozarks Technical Community College continues to draw interest from school districts and donors in the region.</p>
<p>Designed to assist students who are struggling in high school, this program also helps address the needs of students that are historically underserved or lack access to higher education. The underperforming students in the program have greater academic ability and could achieve at a higher level than their present performance.</p>
<p>The unique program, the only one of its kind in Missouri, was initially piloted with Springfield students but next fall will open to area school partners, according to LaRaine Bauer, Director of the Middle College.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are excited to be able to offer our educational services to all area school districts. We know the students will find the program a good match for their educational needs and our area schools will benefit from the positive student results,&rdquo; said Dr. Hal Higdon, president of Ozarks Technical Community College.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In three years, we provided a unique high school experience on a community college campus, helped students earn college credits and completed over 150 internships in our community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition to expanding the program, Middle College has been the recent recipient of a generous $100,000 gift from Jim and Cathy Moore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the right program for these children. It&rsquo;s a great chance for them to succeed. We want to help the kids who need help,&rdquo; Jim Moore said.</p>
<p>Higdon said the gift would go a long way in helping the program.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The generous gift from Jim and Cathy Moore gives our Middle College program the ability to remain a leader in meeting the needs of the students who are enrolled in it,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Since its start several years ago, the program has grown to 76 students on campus with 32 students scheduled to graduate this May.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The framework has developed into a program that is a contemporary model of alternative education,&rdquo; Bauer said.</p>

		<title>Middle College student's speech wows audience</title>

                    <P>Her speech was only 233 words long but the message produced many more words of reaction when she was finished.</P>
<P>Racheal Hunt, who was a student in OTCs Middle College several years ago, spoke at a recent College Development program about her time at OTC and how it changed her life.</P>
<P>"I found my life line (at OTC). I found my self-worth and my purpose," said Hunt who graduates next month with a degree in Early Childhood Development and will start at Missouri State in January.</P>
<P>Her speech turned emotional midway through as her voice wavered from the podium.</P>
<P>"I owe a great deal of my success to the people in this audience," she said to the hundreds who were listening. "Without Middle College, Im not sure I would have ever gone to college."</P>
<P>LaRaine Bauer, dean of special academic programs at OTC, which includes the Middle College, said, "to say we are proud of her is an understatement. She is a shining example of the hope we have for each student who starts at Middle College.&nbsp;We provided her with the opportunity, and she turned it into gold."</P>
<P>Hunt, 20, came to the Middle College program after attending Central High School during freshman and sophomore years until she was in a severe car accident and missed a lot of school. Her grades dropped and she came to the Middle College in 2009 to continue her studies.</P>
<P>As part of the program, Hunt is currently working at Isabel House where she interacts with children who are brought in from crisis situations.</P>
<P>At Middle College, Hunt said instructors pushed her "in a loving way" to excel. She got the help she needed to pass her courses. </P>
<P>It was Bauer who convinced Hunt to give the speech. The two of them worked on it together. After the speech, Hunt went into the audience to find Bauer and the two hugged.</P>
<P>Hunt was nervous about the speech at first but "I found a few faces in the crowd that I knew and it was OK then. I've always been kind of a talker but never in front of that many people."</P>

		<title>Military students have choice between G.I. bills</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
                    
                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>Military veterans entering college now have an additional choice when it comes to financing their education.</p>
<p>The new Post-9/11 G.I. Bill, which went into effect Aug. 1, offers new financial aid options to veterans who joined the military after Sept. 11, 2001.</p>
<p>Both the new bill and the longstanding Montgomery G.I. Bill, which post-9/11 veterans also are eligible for, make money available for college.</p>
<p>But the two bills are drastically difference in the amount of money offered and the way it is distributed.</p>
<p>Veterans must pick which bill they want to use for financing their education and once they choose, they can&rsquo;t change their mind, according to the new bill&rsquo;s guidelines.</p>
<p>Judy Chaplin, VA certifying official at Ozarks Technical Community College, said veterans should study the options carefully because there are advantages to staying with Montgomery G.I. Bill and not using the Post-9/11 version.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Veterans are not required to take the new plan,&rdquo; Chapin said.</p>
<p>Here are the major differences between the two bills:</p>
<p>&bull; Under the Montgomery G.I. Bill, veterans receive a monthly check of $1,321directly, no matter what the cost of a college education. Veterans must pay all their expenses from that check and can keep any money leftover</p>
<p>&bull;Under the new Post-9/11 G.I. Bill, the Veteran&rsquo;s Administration pays the entire tuition bill directly to the college, Veterans also receive a $1,000 annual book allowance and a monthly housing allowance based on where the veteran attends school. For this area, the allowance is $910 a month.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>Chaplin said many veterans attending OTC and any other Missouri colleges are eligible for the Missouri Returning Heroes tuition reduction that caps all tuition at $50 per credit hour.</p>
<p>Under the old G.I. Bill, veterans can keep the difference left after paying the $50 rate.</p>
<p>Under the new G.I. Bill, the government pays the college and the reduced tuition rate is not applied. &nbsp;Also, under the new bill, there is no housing allowance given for those taking online courses. Veterans must take at least one seated class.</p>
<p>One advantage of the new bill is the ability of veterans to transfer the education benefits to their spouse or child. Under the old bill, that&rsquo;s not allowed.</p>
<p>Chaplin said that while she is prohibited in making recommendations to veterans on what bill to choose, she said she is advising veterans who contact her to study their options carefully before making their choice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once you choose, you can&rsquo;t change your mind. The choice is irrevocable,&rdquo; Chaplin said.</p>

                    <P>With the opening of summer semester classes today, the OTC Mobile Hearing Lab will prepare to go on the road to offer hearing instrument science training to students at St. Charles Community College and at OTC.</P>
<P>The mobile lab&nbsp;was&nbsp;developed&nbsp;through&nbsp;a grant&nbsp;from the federal Department of Labor. A grant&nbsp;from Gov. Jay Nixon's Training for Tomorrow paid for the design of the program's curriculum. Both grants were designed to educate Missourians in high-tech fields and get them working in growing industries.</P>
<P>"The mobile hearing lab is truly a great instruction/learning tool for the students. It has provided greater ease of access to the latest technology offered in the field of hearing instrument science. All student participants have expressed great satisfaction with their experience," said Larry Brethower, hearing instrument science program director</P>
<P>The vehicle will be in St. Charles Jun 14-15 and July 12-13 and at OTC June 21-22 and July 19-20.</P>
<P>The mobile lab offer instruction opportunities for all labs offered through the OTC Hearing Instrument Science coursework.</P>
<P>In addition, the mobile vehicle has:</P>
<UL>
<LI>A full size sound room is in the back of the mobile unit with instructor access to an LED projector from both the front instructor station and the back instructor station. </LI>
<LI>An audiometer, probe microphone equipment, and ANSI hearing instrument test box located next to the sound room.&nbsp; </LI>
<LI>All of the data generated can be displayed to the students via the LED projector and screen.&nbsp; </LI>
<LI>Each student station is equipped with its own overhead locker to store student personal items and supplies for each lab session.&nbsp; </LI>
<LI>The student stations are networked into a server within the mobile lab and also have wireless Internet access. This provides the students and instructors with an opportunity to review their current Blackboard instruction assignments; and interactively discuss both current and future topics.</LI></UL>
<P>Registration continues for summer classes and fall registration is continuing with those classes scheduled to begin Aug. 19.</P>

                    <p>Whether he&rsquo;s helping an OTC student find some library resource material or playing a challenging piece of classical guitar music, Mike Madden is at ease with either task.</p>
<p>Madden, who has been at OTC 20 years and now serves as its dean of learning resources, has gone back and forth from the library profession to that of an accomplished musician.</p>
<p>He grew up in a house constantly listening to music, either recorded or played on the piano by his mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard my mother playing piano all of the time when I was little; Bach, Rachmaninoff, Liszt, Chopin,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The instilled love of music took Madden to the Kansas City Conservatory of Music. When he became the first to graduate from there with a degree in classical guitar, Madden played professionally while looking for a teaching job. But after a stint selling suits in St. Louis, Madden got a tip on a possible job in the University City public library.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t care much for selling suits so I took the job with the library,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>After earning his master&rsquo;s in library science, Madden worked for the Springfield-Greene County library, and for 14 years as the guitar instructor at MSU, before eventually coming to work in the Learning Resources Center at OTC.</p>
<p>Madden continues to play occasionally in the area and he can be found performing at Scallions, the OTC student-operated restaurant that is open on Thursdays during the fall and spring semesters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always liked classical music. I tried some folk but I am one who reads sheet music. I can&rsquo;t play jazz or the improvisational music,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Music is very important to me because it is the one constant that has flowed through my life.&nbsp; Always there, always both a challenge and a comfort, always a connection to myself and to others.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>Native American students attending Ozarks Technical Community College can now find support and opportunities through a new campus organization.</p>
<p>The Four Corners Native Association has formed to offer members educational activities, a chance to share cultural heritages and leadership opportunities for the estimated 500 Native Americans on campus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We started organizing last spring. A lot of people signed up at the spring picnic,&rdquo; said Amy McKee, the group&rsquo;s president. &ldquo;We are trying to get our feet on the ground with events and meetings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sadie Hopper, one of the organizers and an advisor in the OTC Financial Aid office, said she found more than 300 Native Americans have applied to OTC in the last two years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I soon found many more who had not self-identified when applying,&rdquo; she said, adding that in the past two years, about 30 students representing 15-20 different tribes had applied for Native American scholarships offered through their tribes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By creating a sustainable Four Corners Native Association, we hope to encourage more students from this demographic to apply for admission to OTC and for financial aid,&rdquo; Hopper said.</p>
<p>The group is open to not only OTC students but also students from Drury University and the general public. The first general meeting will be Tuesday, Aug. 31 at 1 p.m. in the student lounge area outside Student Services on the second floor of Information Commons West.</p>
<p>McKee said the group will work towards improving communications between people and communities for future collaboration with agencies and programs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just a student organization. We want staff and faculty and members of the community who want to learn about Native American heritage to join and attend the meetings and events,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Students can get the information they need and have a place to go. Our goal is to help each other and be a resource.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For more information, contact Amy McKee at am0161861@otc.edu.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Ryan White, a graduate of OTC&rsquo;s networking program, was surprised and excited when he got a call this summer from the folks at Microsoft offering him a position with the well-known computer software company.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;I was kind of shocked. I didn&rsquo;t expect it,&rdquo; said White, who is the first OTC graduate and employee to be hired by Microsoft.</span></p>
<p><span>White, who worked full-time at the college after graduation, beat out hundreds of applicants from around the world to become one of a handful of new premier field engineers.</span></p>
<p><span>As a premier engineer, White installs SharePoint for companies and trains their employees in its use. SharePoint is a collaborative software that allows multiple users from remote sites to work together electronically on projects and programs.</span></p>
<p><span>White, who works out of the company&rsquo;s Chicago office, said he went through a series of interviews with the company in order to get the position. </span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t have any of my hopes up of going to work for one of the pinnacle companies, but after three interviews, they offered me the job,&rdquo; he said.</span></p>
<p><span>White, who served six years in the U.S. Navy as an electronics technician before enrolling at OTC in 2005, worked part-time in the College&rsquo;s information technology department while a student while earning degrees in both networking and computer repair. </span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Everything I did at OTC, from classes to working in IT, helped me. I was working on Microsoft technology at OTC and it solidified my spot with Microsoft because of that experience,&rdquo; he said.</span></p>
<p><span>White&rsquo;s work sends him across the country. In just a few months, he&rsquo;s been to San Antonio, St. Louis, Seattle and Santa Ana, Calif. </span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lot different traveling all the time, but I&rsquo;ve always wanted to work for Microsoft,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been wanting to do it for a long time.&rdquo;</span></p>

                    <SPAN lang=EN>
<P dir=ltr align=left>After being named as the colleges new Dean of Allied Health, Sherry Taylor might be known in some parts of the OTC system as the new Dr. Steve. She recently replaced Dr. Steve Bishop, who was promoted to provost/vice chancellor of academic affairs.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>But Taylor, who was appointed to the post earlier this month, doesn't mind. She's more than ready to take the reigns from Bishop and continue to advance the department as he did during his tenure.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"It's good to have someone like Steve Bishop in the position he's in. He knows what our program is all about. He's there for us," she said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Taylor, who has been at OTC for about nine years, said part of her job will be serving as an advocate in the community for the department and its fields of study.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"The community respects OTC and our Allied Health department. Hospitals request our students and many of them have jobs waiting for them before they even graduate. We have good community contacts," she said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>The Allied Health department, one of the most popular areas of study at the college, has waiting lists of students who want to get into one of the programs. </P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"We are looking for ways to expand our programs to benefit students, and in the future we may move more classes to the Richwood Valley campus where we have already placed our medical lab technician and physical therapy assistant programs," she said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Several major additions to the overall Allied Health department are in the works. </P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Last week, the Board of Trustees approved funding for the creation of a simulation center on campus that will house state-of-the-art mannequins for use by students in various fields of study, including Surgical Assistant, Nursing and Dental Hygiene.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Later this year, the first mobile hearing instrument technician vehicle will roll out with OTC personnel traveling to other state community colleges to teach the Hearing Instrument Science.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"I'm excited about the future," Taylor said. "I want to continue to grow the programs as Dr. Bishop did and add programs as needed. I'm so fortunate to have people I work with who are passionate about their field."</P>

		<title>New assessment approach helps writing students</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
                    
                    <P>Employers have been concerned that college graduates don't know how to communicate well, especially when it comes to writing.</P>
<P>So, after years of research and classroom work, OTC developmental English instructor Jennifer Dunkel has been able to help assess students' readiness for college-level writing.</P>
<P>A new assessment program has been put into place in the OTC developmental writing program that helps both students and instructors assess how well a student can write before that student advances to other English classes.</P>
<P>The ability of college students to write proficiently has been an issue among potential employers, said Dunkel, one of the lead instructors of the Colleges Developmental English program.</P>
<P>"There are so many reports available that talk about how employers expect that college graduates know how to communicate well and think critically," she said. </P>
<P>"We in the developmental writing program believe that our assessment process is one small way to help students develop the foundations of good writing and thinking skills they will need to be successful in college-level courses and the professional workplace."</P>
<P>The program was in its pilot stages for several semesters, until a grant paid for instructor training in 2012. Now, all sections of developmental English use the process. Under it, students have to pass two of three requirements: individual instructors coursework, a standardized final exam and an exit-essay. </P>
<P>"We believe that a combination of these helps give us a clearer picture of what's happening both at the individual course level and the department level," Dunkel said.</P>
<P>Students work on their writing proficiencies for two weeks before final exams. Last year, 1,346 essays were evaluated. Instructors got together for three days before finals to evaluate the students work.</P>
<P>Last fall, there were 805 essays submitted and 75 percent passed.</P>
<P>Provost and Vice Chancellor of Academic Affairs Steven Bishop said he's pleased with the early outcomes.</P>
<P>"This process assures that students are graded fairly and instructors have clear criteria to assess their students," Bishop said. "This collaborative process that Jennifer coordinated not only improves the grading process but also improves writing instruction since teachers share their best ideas on a quality piece of writing."</P>
<P>Dunkel said in addition to helping students better prepare for advanced English classes, the assessment also helps instructors see if they need to change how they teach the course.</P>
<P>"It gives them a way of seeing how others are teaching and what works and what doesn't," she said. "I am fortunate to work with so many instructors who have helped make this assessment process what it has become. The ultimate goal is, of course, to help our students succeed, and that comes from ongoing collaborative efforts."</P>

<P>But Stephen Biermann, dean of technical education at OTC, believes a new the new Classic Car Restoration workshop being offered this summer can offer those who have been thinking about fixing up some classic car a chance to learn first-hand how to do it.</P>
<P>"Classic car shows and restoring those types of cars are very popular in the area," Biermann said. "We want to offer those in the community a chance to try it and see what they think."</P>
<P>With car shows being held almost every weekend in the spring and summer, starting with the OTC Community Day car show in April that draws almost 100 cars followed by some national car shows at the Ozarks Empire Fairgrounds, Biermann said those with the itch to get involved will want to take advantage of the workshop.</P>
<P>"There are so many shows in the area, this is an opportunity for both those who already are showing cars and those just beginning to enroll," Biermann said.</P>
<P>The workshop will be held at the OTC Springfield Campus July 7-31 on Monday through Thursday each week from 5-9 p.m.</P>
<P>The class will be taught by one of the colleges automotive faculty and will include training in a variety of areas needed to turn a project car into a classic.</P>
<P>The class will be working on a 1963 Ford Galaxy 500 two-door. It has a 390-cubic-inch engine and a four-speed transmission. Some participants can bring their own cars in for work on a limited basis.</P>
<P>Training will include body work (straightening, priming and painting), interior work, glass and mechanical work (engine and drivetrain). In addition, participants can pick up tips on how to prepare for a car show, what to expect at a show and what judges look for in a competition.</P>
<P>The workshop is a non-credit offering so those participating do not have to enroll in college. </P>
<P>"There is something for everyone to learn here. Enthusiasts will learn various aspects of car restoration that they haven't heard or seen before," Biermann said. </P>
<P>To register or to get more information, call 447-8888.</P>

		<title>New classroom design helps students, teachers do more</title>

                    <SPAN lang=EN>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Normally, its a new type of class that gathers attention among students, but this time, its a new classroom that has everyone talking at OTC.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>The classroom is located on the second floor of Information Commons West and is used for English classes.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>What makes it different is the moveable desks and the computer monitors, which are mounted on the walls instead of atop conventional fixed-in-place desks.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>The redesign was the idea of the English department. The desks are mobile and slide across a room easily. The worktops can be flipped and turned to accommodate a left-handed or right-handed student. There are even cup holders in the desks base.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"The value of the classroom is the flexibility it affords both teachers and students, as well as the interaction it promotes teacher-to-student as well as student-to-student," said Richard Turner, chair of the English department.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>No longer are students blocked from each other and from the teacher by monitors in their faces. Instead, they are free to arrange themselves in a way that best promotes engagement and learning, given the needs of the lesson at the time and the individual student.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Jennifer Dunkel, who teaches developmental English in the classroom, praises the advantages the room gives her and her students.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"My favorite part of the new classroom, by far, is the new desks. The mobile design allows us to move from lecture to small-group activities to large-group discussions with ease," she said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"One of the problems with the old set-up of the class was that the computers sat on top of the desks. It is no exaggeration to say that I've had classes where I could only see my students eyebrows and tops of heads."</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>In the new classroom, Dunkel can move in and around the students without being blocked. She can ask students to cluster into small groups to discuss study topics or prepare presentations.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"Mobile desks give students control over their environment. They can move around to any part of the room. If students can't see the board, they can move their entire desk up to the front without having to pack up and relocate from one fixed desk to another," she said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Ethan Schlesener, a student in Dunkel's class, said he liked the new classroom design.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"The chairs are pretty sweet," he said. "You don't have to get up to throw anything away."</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P></SPAN>

		<title>New Health Professions Academy a success </title>

                    <P>Kelly Peachey wanted to be a pediatrician since she was in grade school. Now, with the help of the new Innovation Campus - Health Professions Academy at Ozarks Technical Community College, the 17-year-old from Glendale High School has received a big boost toward achieving her goal.</P>
<P>"The Academy has been very good preparation for working in the healthcare field," Peachey said. "It's a good environment and has good teachers."</P>
<P></P>
<P>The Innovation Campus Academy began this past fall and is designed for high school students who want a career in the health care industry. A cooperative partnership between OTC, Missouri State University, Greene County, The Springfield Business Development Corporation, Springfield Public Schools, CoxHealth and Mercy Health Systems made the Innovation Campus Academy possible. The program is funded through a $1 million Innovation Campus Grant, which Governor Jay Nixon announced in the summer of 2012. At the time of the announcement, Gov. Nixon said, "Innovation Campuses create a direct connection for Missouri students between the skills they learn in the classroom, and the skills that are in demand today. Not only will students be trained for solid careers in growing industries, they'll be able to earn those degrees in less time with lower debt as a result." </P>
<P>Participating students begin taking college coursework in an early start program as high school juniors and seniors. They have the potential to earn an associate degree from OTC and a bachelor's degree from Missouri State in a variety of healthcare fields within three to five years after high school graduation. Once students have earned a bachelor's degree, they will be eligible for priority hiring at Mercy and CoxHealth.</P>
<P>"The Academy gives students a head start on their future careers, enabling them to obtain their collegiate prerequisite allied health classes," said Jessica Crocker, an Academy instructor.&nbsp;"This program is for topflight students, offers a rigorous, accelerated program of study with selected college courses relevant to a wide variety of allied health degrees."</P>
<P>Jezreel Irving, a junior from Parkview High School, said the work is challenging, "The best part is the freedom and responsibility that comes with being here. It's more work than high school but they treat you like you're in college. I'm ready for college now." </P>
<P></P>
<P>Savanna Burnett, 17, from Hillcrest High School, agreed with Jezreel's assessment, "I like that it's challenging," she said. "Before, at high school, everything was so easy. Here, I have to apply myself to earn a good grade."</P>
<P></P>
<P>Dr. LaRaine Bauer, who oversees the academy through OTC's Middle College program, said the transition for students is amazing.</P>
<P>"Starting college early may sound scary to some students," she said, "but once students experience the sense of freedom associated with attending class on a college campus, they never regret their decision to leave traditional high school behind."</P>

                    <P>Cooking to please the family can be a tough task, but cooking to please the palates of thousands of students, faculty and staff can be next to impossible.</P>
<P>But Nora McAmis-Payne, food service manager at OTC, has faced the challenge head-on with positive results.</P>
<P>McAmis-Payne, who came to OTC last year after six years of working for Sodexo food service group at Missouri State University, oversees the daily operation of the college's Café 101.</P>
<P>The café serves hundreds of meals a day to those on the Springfield campus. One of her first additions was to build up the menu and offer a daily special that was a cut above the routine fare of hot dogs and burgers.</P>
<P>"The menu needed some tweaking. We wanted to increase meal options and offer a wide variety of items that were high-end meals at a low price. We wanted to offer something that isn't everyday run-of-the-mill meals," McAmis-Payne said.</P>
<P>Helping her with that task is Peter Tracy, the former executive chef for Sodexo at MSU. He came to OTC this summer and has put his mark on the menu, too.</P>
<P>The two worked together at MSU, where they also prepared meals for the stars that performed on campus, including Elton John, Bonnie Raitt and George Carlin.</P>
<P>McAmis-Payne decides what dishes to offer as specials and Tracy designs the recipes based on the products available.</P>
<P>"We use the freshest ingredients we can get our hands on. We make the meals from scratch, from pounding the meat ourselves for a chicken-fried steak to the fixings for our taco salad that's become a favorite on Fridays," she said.</P>
<P>Dishes range in price from $5.99 to $6.99 and that includes a side dish and drink.</P>
<P>Tracy said he enjoys pushing the envelope with some of the dishes he has tried, including offering falafel, curries and stuffed meatloaf on certain days.</P>
<P>"In coming up with the specials, I wanted to take it to the next level. I wanted to offer home-cooked meals I love. Falafel is a popular item. It's gone over well,"Tracy said.</P>
<P>&nbsp;"I like doing things off the wall."</P>
<P><EM>Steve Koehler is coordinator of media relations at Ozarks Technical Community College.</EM></P>

<P>Tiffany Brunner has seen the groundbreaking work Ozarks Technical Community College has been doing for young students during her tenure as assistant principal at Republic High School.</P>
<P>This year, she decided to join the OTC team.</P>
<P>Brunner is the new director of the OTC Middle College program, which provides a variety of career education opportunities to high school students who are challenged in a typical high school environment.</P>
<P>"Republic was sending students to Middle College," she said. "In education today, kids are missing hands-on educational experiences. They don't get engaged."</P>
<P>At the Middle College, students pick from six career areas to study in both the classroom and through internships. The newest area is the Health Professions Academy.</P>
<P>"The Health Professions Academy, new in fall 2013, is an amazing college transition program for students who elect to start college early as a junior in high school and focus on careers in health care," Brunner said.</P>
<P>"Students can earn 30-40 college credits for free before they even graduate from high school. Starting college early may sound scary to some students, but once students experience the sense of freedom associated with attending class on a college campus, they never regret their decision to leave traditional high school behind."</P>
<P>OTC is accepting applications now for the academy, and applicants can apply online at<A href="http://www.otc.edu/highschool">otc.edu/highschool</A> through the Middle College program.</P>
<P>Brunner said she plans to work to expand the career offerings and bring degree programs to high school students.</P>
<P>"There is a national trend where high school students can earn an associate's degree. It's called Early College," she said. "It's like our health academy where the best and the brightest come to learn."</P>
<P>The Middle College program was led from the start by LaRaine Bauer, who had become the college's director of special programs.</P>
<P>Brunner said it would be a challenge moving into Bauer's spot.</P>
<P>"She was a groundbreaking force in establishing the Middle College," Brunner said. "Through her hard work, the Middle College got to where it is today. There's a lot to learn from her."</P></DIR></DIR></DIR>

		<title>New motorcycle classes to begin at Springfield campus</title>

                    <p>OTC&rsquo;s Community Enrichment Center will soon begin offering basic motorcycle instructions at the OTC Springfield campus.</p>
<p>The beginner classes give new riders a chance to prepare for the required state street test in order to gain a motorcycle license. In addition, students are taught basic survival skills in motorcycle driving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything you learn in the class can translate into how you use your bike. You drive over 2 X 4s, and you learn how to handle locked brakes,&rdquo; said Lori Minor, community safety specialist for the CEC.</p>
<p>The classes had been held at the College's TTI center in Ozark but had to be stopped because of parking lot conditions. Classes are still being held at the MODOT headquarters on East Kearney Street.</p>
<p>The new classes will be held in the CEC building and the full-sized test range being stripped on Parking Lot O, just southwest of the CEC offices.</p>
<p>Beginners don&rsquo;t have to own a motorcycle in order to take the class. Motorcycles and helmets are provided during class.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will help some who are deciding if they want to buy a bike,&rdquo; Minor said.</p>
<p>Students can use their own bike but the motor has to be less than 500ccs. Owners of the scooter-type 49cc models can also take the class for riding basics.</p>
<p>For the first time, the program will offer classes in driving the popular three-wheel motorcycles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a new category for us. It can be the traditional-style bike with two wheels in the back or the new ones with two wheels in the front,&rdquo; Minor said.</p>
<p>Taking the class will help riders obtain a discount from their insurance carriers in most cases, Minor said.</p>
<p>Some riders are required to take the class if they fail to pass the state&rsquo;s street test three times. Others, who are ticketed for careless and imprudent driving, can take the class to have their sentence reduced. &nbsp;The CEC program is only one in the state where ticketed drivers are sent from the court..</p>
<p>The classes are a total of 18 hours and are held over a Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The new classes are expected to begin in early August. More information is available by calling 447-8888.</p>

		<title>New name, connections are top priorities for IT group</title>

                    <p>Picking a new name and making new connections with students have been top priorities for the southwest Missouri information technology consortium.</p>
<p>Now known as the Mid-America Technology Alliance, the group will continue to work with the OTC Center for Workforce Development in providing leadership to the growing technology sector of the region, said Sherry Coker, business manager for OTC&rsquo;s workforce center and a member of the MATA executive council.</p>
<p>Coker said the new name gives the alliance a goal to grow into the name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It lets people know we are serious. It gives us a name we can market,&rdquo; Coker said.</p>
<p>The name change is part of the group&rsquo;s broader plan to pursue funding to further the mission and purpose of the alliance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having a name that truly links the industry purpose with the region will best serve to build a competitive and sustainable IT talent force,&rdquo; said Dawn Busick, executive director of the workforce center.</p>
<p>There are more than 40 members of the alliance, including those from technology companies as well as government entities, participate in bi-monthly discussions centered on attracting and developing IT talent.</p>
<p>The alliance is working to reach out to local schools to attract students to technology careers. Next month, the group will hear from Rhonda Mammen, coordinator of counseling/Title IV for Springfield R-12 school district. The meeting is Oct. 14 at the Springfield Area Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Mammen will give alliance members an overview of the career counseling services available to middle, junior high and high school students and how her team assists students in identifying career paths.</p>
<p>An Oct. 5 college and career fair sponsored by the Springfield school district and Springfield Chamber of Commerce will include &mdash; for the first time &mdash; representatives from IT fields.</p>
<p>&ldquo;High school graduates were coming into college not fully aware of the range of technology careers available to them. This led us to want to examine the type of counseling going on in the area of IT,&rdquo; Coker said. &ldquo;We want to talk about what&rsquo;s happening and what MATA can do to help.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>Bad winter weather can play havoc with electrical lines, causing power outages and creating a need for highly skilled electric line workers.</p>
<p>Some of those workers will get their initial training in a specialized electric line worker program begun recently at Ozarks Technical Community College.</p>
<p>OTC, in cooperation with a consortium of utility companies, co-operatives and labor groups, is providing an 11-week Pre-Apprentice Electric Line Program to help companies screen potential candidates for their own electric line work apprentice programs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Each utility and co-op conducts their own apprentice program. What we are doing is some pre-screening in math and pole climbing, plus giving students an overview of equipment, tools and blueprints,&rdquo; said Cindy Stephens, chief operations officer of OTC&rsquo;s Center for Workforce Development.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This helps the companies avoid investing in someone who would not be a good fit for that position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A full class of 16 students is preparing for the pole-climbing assessment test that will take place Jan. 16. Candidates had to pass a math exam to advance to the pole assessment.</p>
<p>While completing the program does not guarantee anyone a job, it does give students a leg up over those who haven&rsquo;t had the training.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great opportunity for the students because they experience many facets of the industry and know if this is the proper choice for them,&rdquo; Stephens said.</p>
<p>Debbie Krieder, manager of human resources for City Utilities, which has 40 line workers and troubleshooters, said electric line workers are hard to find.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The OTC program allows CU to know if the applicants they selected for the apprentice program have the skills and capabilities to do the job,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>To be placed on the waiting list for the program send an e-mail to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">CWD@otc.edu</span> or call 447-8901.</p>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Fall classes at Ozarks Technical Community College begin Aug. 20 and overall enrollment is expected to crack the 12,000 mark this semester.</p>
<p>Last year, fall enrollment was 11,109, up nearly 1,000 from the year before and the projection is for enrollment to be up by nearly 10 percent again this year as class registration entered its final week.</p>
<p>When students arrive, they will find some new surroundings.</p>
<p>Additions to the Springfield campus include the $1.8 million addition to the west side of the Norman K. Myers Technical Education Center that was dedicated earlier this week</p>
<p>The project was funded through the Lewis and Clark Discovery Initiative, a part of the Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority (MOHELA).</p>
<p>The two-story addition to the center, named for the College&rsquo;s founding president, will provide additional classroom space, a commodity that is in greater demand every semester at the College. In addition, some remodeling has been done to the existing building, including the conversion of office space into classrooms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The campus bookstore, previously operated by a private company, has been taken over by the College and has undergone some renovation and refurbishing.</p>
<p>At the College&rsquo;s Richwood Valley campus, construction of a new storm shelter is complete. The facility, built to withstand 250-mile-per-hour winds, will house 1,382 people. It was built at a cost of $1.5 million with 75 percent of the money coming from a FEMA grant and 25 percent from the College.</p>
<p>The shelter is 9,665 square feet 6,911 square feet of usable space. There is also a new parking lot being built to accommodate citizens coming to use the shelter.</p>
<p>Richwood Valley will also be the home to the College&rsquo;s Physical Therapy Assistant program for the first time this fall. Last year, the College moved the Medical Lab Technician program to Richwood Valley.</p>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Balancing a college class schedule with a work schedule can be a tricky task but very common, and the numbers prove it.</p>
<p>A snapshot of students attending Ozarks Technical Community College this fall showed 75 percent of the students were planning to work, with 90 percent of them working more than 20 hours a week.</p>
<p>To help students balance work and school, OTC officials this fall began offering several Allied Health courses at night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To accommodate work schedules is the primary reason for offering the night courses. We also have several homemakers who do not have childcare during the day,&rdquo; said Stephen Bishop, dean of Allied Health. &nbsp;</p>
<p>For those who couldn&rsquo;t come on campus, OTC has expanded its online course offerings. As a result, the number of students taking Web-based courses increased 28 percent over last fall. There are 3,936 students enrolled in at least one online course this Fall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the average age of an OTC student taking a seated class is 26, the average age of an online student is 29 who tend to have a heavy work schedule.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Older students have jobs, families, and lots of other commitments that make online learning not only more attractive but really the only viable way to pursue a higher education,&rdquo; said C. DeWitt Salley, Jr., director of Online Teaching and Learning.</p>
<p>Kelly Jackson of Springfield, who works 30 hours a week and takes four classes online, said it would be impossible for her to go to college if it wasn&rsquo;t for online courses being available.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can do my homework on Saturday or at night. It&rsquo;s very convenient,&rdquo; said Jackson, who plans to earn her Associate of Arts degree in education and then transfer to a four-year college or university.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way I could make time to go to a seated class.&rdquo;</p>

                    <P>When Roger Gray speaks, he hopes people listen.</P>
<P>The 73-year-old OTC student has been lending his rich, baritone voice to radio commercials and audio books for several years but recently enrolled at the college to expand his knowledge in audio engineering through the Electronic Media Program.</P>
<P>"Hes been doing voice-over work at the house for some years and took a class here to catch up in what's new in audio. Weve adjusted the curriculum in order to meet his needs and accomplish what he needs to do," said Jeff Johnson, EMP instructor who has Gray in his class.</P>
<P>Grays class project is putting together a demo reel that he can use on his soon-to-be complete Web site that will allow him to expand his horizons in the voice-over business.</P>
<P>"Most voice people freelance. There are a lot of jobs available online," said Gray, who came to Springfield in the 1980s when his mother moved to Branson.</P>
<P>Using his voice is the most recent career in a list that includes being a group speaker and pastoring counselor in former lives. Gray also had a radio show in the 1960s and was doing free radio ads for friends. At the time, Gray said, he was too busy to pursue a voice career.</P>
<P>Several years ago, Gray saw a notice for a voice-coaching class being held at the OTC Community Enrichment Center. He attended that class and then decided to go to work on his own voicing commercials and audio books business.</P>
<P>He has a home studio but is in class now to learn the ins and outs of producing and engineering along with computer training. Hes taking theater classes to work on how to use his voice.</P>
<P>"I could hardly turn on a computer. I learned some of it through YouTube," he said.</P>
<P>Gray, who overcame prostrate cancer many years ago, has five brothers and three have the same rich voice as him, but theyve never pursued a voice career.</P>
<P>He has voiced 11 audiobooks and has a contract to do three more. He hopes after completing the EMP courses, he will have a better knowledge of what goes into the work and be able to publicize his new skills because he has no plans of slowing down.</P>
<P>"I tried retirement 10 years ago and Ill never try that again. I can do voice-over work for a long time, anywhere in the world," he said.</P>

                    <P>The classroom is packed. Every chair is full and 2 extra seats are pulled in to accommodate the students who want to take this class.&nbsp; We are 6 weeks into the semester and all 32 students who signed up for this U.S. History class are present.&nbsp; I've heard good things about Jennifer Bump's teaching but this level of attendance still surprises me.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Jennifer is a bit of an actor and grabs the attention of her students using short clips of music. When a student gave a good response to a question Jennifer said, "That is right and do you know what I owe you?" With a click of the computer, a short audio clip of "Eye of the Tiger" played for a quick congratulations.&nbsp;&nbsp; A short musical clip from Nelly singing, "It must be the money" helped reinforce the economic factors that lead to the French and Indian War.&nbsp; As a musical memory jogger Jennifer played a snippet of Queen singing, "We are the Champions" to highlight the British arrogance after capturing additional land during the war and how it played a role in worsening the relationship between Britain and the American colonies.&nbsp; All of these audio music clips took only seconds but grabbed my attention and made class more fun.&nbsp; I also found that the music clips made it easier to have a hook to help recall the information.&nbsp; When I try to recall the major participants of the French and Indian War, I remember the clip of Stevie Nicks singing "who, who, who" and the names of the major players come readily to mind.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Surrounding the attention-grabbers are good teaching techniques to make sure students are not just entertained but learn.&nbsp; Jennifer decided to try incorporating music into her history class after reading studies that link music to learning retention.&nbsp; After putting this technique into practice Jennifer said, "I can reference any one of those songs now, and they will generally recall the information that corresponds.&nbsp; I'm still working the kinks out, but I think it's getting there.&nbsp; The most important strategy that I employ is adaptability.&nbsp; I have to be willing to try new things and realize that not every strategy will work the same in every classroom.&nbsp; I may have to change things up a bit if necessary." <BR><STRONG>Teaching nugget</STRONG><BR>A good teacher, like a good entertainer first must hold his audience's attention, then he can teach his lesson. (John Henrik Clarke)</P>
<P><STRONG>Great joke to start the week</STRONG><BR>Dr. James Gardner, a retired Vice-President of Academic Affairs and one of our Adjunct Sociology Instructors sent me the following email.&nbsp; He obviously missed his calling as a comedian.<BR><BR>"I wanted to share with you my new innovations and hope it leads to a Rubber Chicken award and recognition of a ground breaking innovation in learning. I recently implemented a new method of sharing notes with students that I believe is original and will have long lasting effects. Here's how it works, I have moved from using the "yellow tablet" notes to showing my notes on an overhead projector. Man, the students sure like it and a sub innovation I have come up with is I found out that I can use a sheet of paper to cover the information I don't want students to see and then reveal it when I get to the subject matter I want to present. I think this will change the way we do education forever. I would be happy to provide this information during an in-service for faculty if you think it is groundbreaking, of course, a large stipend would be expected. Looking forward to acquiring "Rubber Chicken" status."</P>

                    <P></P>
<P>Welcome back to a new semester.&nbsp; On our opening day, we had a few lost and wandering students but overall the semester started with minimal problems and a lot of excitement.&nbsp; Our college wide theme for academics is "Celebrate Potential."&nbsp; In keeping with this theme, I will be sharing ideas through regular <I>Nourishing the Teacher</I> e-mails that focus on innovative and creative ways that we can get our students actively engaged and maximize their potential.&nbsp; This first week I will focus on getting your students enthusiastic about your class. </P>
<P>I recently talked with a music teacher who started his music course <I>Sight Singing and Ear Training</I> by playing a difficult classical song. He then had the students try to transcribe the notes.&nbsp; After everyone failed miserably, he told the class that ear training is really hard but important.&nbsp; This message was generally lost on the students who did not relate to the classical piece or care about being able to transcribe the music.&nbsp; He recently changed the lead-in to his course by playing a popular song that came out in the last two weeks.&nbsp; He played a short snippet of the song and then put the students into small groups to transcribe the musical notes.&nbsp; After the groups had struggled with it for a while he reviewed their efforts and praised them for their successes.&nbsp; He then told the class that although this was hard now, they would learn how to do this better.&nbsp; The difference in student enthusiasm that he noted between the two methods of starting the class was amazing.&nbsp; Students could immediately relate to the importance of being able to transcribe a song they wanted to play and were eager to come back to learn more.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Not many of us teach music but the principles he used to engage and excite students can be implemented in any class or to start a new topic.&nbsp; This teacher found a connection between his class and his students' life and interests.&nbsp; He also allowed his students time to work together so they could start building relationships with each other.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even when we are doing a good job in class, it might help to occasionally rethink how we structure our class to keep things interesting for us as well as our students.&nbsp; All of us are tuned into the radio station WII-FM (What's In It - For Me).&nbsp; This is good to keep in mind as we look for ways to motivate our students.&nbsp; I challenge us all to think of new ways to turn on the light bulb with our students.</P>
<P>We have a lot of creative talent within our faculty members. I am eager to hear about what you are doing this year to keep your teaching fresh and effective.&nbsp; Remember to send me your ideas so you can be in the running for the "Sticking-your-neck-out Provost's Innovation Award."&nbsp; </P>

                    <P></P>
<P>My grandfather, Isaac, arrived in the United States in December of 1909. &nbsp;He was only 15 years old when his father sent him across the ocean to bring back his older brother, Richard, who came to the United States for a visit but never returned to Lebanon.&nbsp; Rosie, the older sister, came with Isaac to help convince their brother to return with them to their home country.&nbsp; On arriving in Boston, the immigration officials rushed people through like cattle.&nbsp; Isaac become "Isar" on his intake papers and like most other immigrants he did not correct the mistake for fear of calling too much attention to himself.&nbsp; One of their first encounters in the new country was with three thugs who whistled at Rosie.&nbsp; In that era, to whistle at a young lady was an insult that could not be ignored.&nbsp; Isaac quickly dispatched each thug in turn until they found themselves in the sea water with all the other fishy smelling creatures.&nbsp; &nbsp;Isaac and Rosie were anxious about arriving in America and their first experience was of a cold place full of rude thugs where people spoke a language they did not understand.&nbsp; The anxiety of Isaac and Rosie is not unlike our students entering a classroom for the first class of a new semester.&nbsp; Our students can feel like a stranger in a strange land hearing a language they do not quite understand, with a list of new rules to follow, and someone who does not even get their name right.</P>
<P>The teacher's goal on that first day is to form a community of learners eager to return the second day. Using an ice-breaker related to your subject can help ease students into your subject.&nbsp; Lance Renner starts his Economics class by asking students about some of their favorite models.&nbsp; Some students talk about model airplanes or other similar hobbies.&nbsp; He then asks them what they do if they put money in a vending machine and nothing comes out.&nbsp; We frequently kick or shake the machine even though that seldom solves the problem.&nbsp; We do this because that is the model we carry in our head for how to solve the vending-machine-that-ate-our-money problem.&nbsp; Lance then compares the study of the models of economics to our vending machine model and reassures them that each of them can be as easy to understand.&nbsp; A Name Cycle ice-breaker has each student introduce themself along with their favorite animal such as "My name is Jared and my favorite animal is a jaguar."&nbsp; As each student introduces themselves they also repeat everyone's name that has gone before along with their favorite animal.&nbsp; By the time this exercise is complete, everyone in the class knows each other and you have illustrated an important learning strategy of linking new learning with something else that makes it memorable.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The least important thing you do on the first day of class is to go over your course syllabus.&nbsp; I am not saying that the course syllabus is unimportant since it will be a critical contract with the student throughout the semester but the first day of class sets the tone for the entire semester.&nbsp; The first day should not be about rules to follow but about inspiring students to thirst for what this class will offer.&nbsp; The first day is the perfect opportunity to help students understand the promise your class holds in helping them better understand their world.&nbsp; Find out what questions the students have about the subject. It might be helpful to think back about what interested you about the subject in the first place.&nbsp; When you show your excitement for what drew you to this subject, you may also be able to find the hook that will entice your students. &nbsp;&nbsp;My grandfather fell in love with America and decided to make it his home otherwise I might have grown up in Beirut.&nbsp; Hopefully, the first class will be the start of your students love affair with the subject as well and they will decide to spend a lifetime learning more.&nbsp; </P>

                    <P>Mary Kay Ash, the founder of Mary Kay Cosmetics, is known for giving her top performers a pink Cadillac. She said, "There are two things people want more than sex and money.&nbsp; They are recognition and praise." There are many ways we can give our students recognition and praise but nothing is more powerful for a student than seeing a teacher take their ideas seriously.&nbsp; Several years ago I took a class with Dr. Carol Anne Kardash. On one of my reflection papers she commented, "I very much enjoy reading your reactions. I learn from them and they refine my thinking.&nbsp; I am talking too much in class.&nbsp; Please share your reactions with the class." The knowledge that a teacher I respected took my ideas seriously made such a tremendous impact on me that I still have that note.&nbsp; </P>
<P>A few semesters ago, Zach Zweigle had two students in his American history class who had fought in the Vietnam War. Zach recognized the treasure of knowledge these two veterans could add to the accounts in the text. He asked them to relate their first-hand experience in the war. Zach said, "These firsthand accounts were real and raw. The other students were spellbound by the stories and the veterans were bombarded with questions as a result."&nbsp; Bringing these students into the presentation not only gave the other students a better understanding of this period it also provided the veterans with recognition. Zach said, "Both veterans were so pleased by the student interaction, because many of these veterans came home from the Vietnam War to an unsympathetic country that wanted those events forgotten. They were excited to have a new generation that was interested in their story."&nbsp; </P>
<P>Ken Elkins is one of our experienced World History adjuncts. He had a student in his class who planned to pursue a Ph.D. in Chinese studies. She read voraciously on all aspects of ancient China and Chinese culture. Although Ken was well-versed on the subject, he seized the opportunity to recognize this student's interest. He asked her to review the chapter and provide additional information based on her research. Both student and instructor tackled the topic during their next class period. This made a lasting impact on the student. Years later, during a trip to China, the student had a banner made in Chinese characters for the instructor that stated, "The teacher and his students are very tired at the end of the day."</P>
<P>Tammy Collins has students keep portfolios in her classes. Her students answer questions such as: 1. What is my greatest achievement outside of school and work?; 2. If I knew I could not possibly fail, what would I do?; and 3. What is my best talent?&nbsp; Tammy discovered, "My students were the "coolest" people in the world." Wayne Dyer said, "When you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change." I challenge all of us to take a fresh look at our students and we will see that we have the "coolest" people in the world in our own classes.&nbsp; </P>

                    <p>An Ozarks Technical Community College faculty member&rsquo;s office hours are becoming very popular among his students, not because of when he&rsquo;s available, but where he&rsquo;s located.</p>
<p>Instead of holding office hours on campus, John Fishback, who teaches anatomy and physiology, is available for several hours every Wednesday night at the Borders bookstore in the Primrose Shopping Center.</p>
<p>Fishback, who moved his office hours to the bookstore several semesters ago, said students are more at ease at Borders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More students come to see me there. I used to get one or two students a semester come to my office. Now, it&rsquo;s around 20 and even more when there&rsquo;s a test coming up.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a relaxed atmosphere and they aren&rsquo;t thinking that they&rsquo;re bothering the teacher. It&rsquo;s not an intimidating setting at Borders,&rdquo; Fishback said.</p>
<p>Biology department chair Marianne Crocker has moved her office hours to parallel Fishback&rsquo;s. Since the pair have some of the same students, now those students have access to both faculty members at once</p>
<p>Megan Fields attended the sessions with her newborn baby in tow last semester and said it was a big help with her studies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could talk to other people about things and they helped me remember things and Mr. Fishback was there to clarify and explain things,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Fishback and his wife, Sarah Nixon, who (teaches?) is in the education department at Missouri State University, are studying the sessions for a research project.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to see if the struggling students, the C student, is being helped. We want to promote this as a way to get extra help with one-on-one attention. Students get a high retention rate when you get to know them personally. You build personal relationships. The student is much more involved,&rdquo; Fishback said.</p>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>Carl Locke, who has taught in Springfield schools for 50 years, will be retiring this week from Ozarks Technical Community College.</p>
<p>One of the last, if not the last, faculty member to have taught at both Graff Area Voc-Tech and OTC, Locke started as a teacher in Springfield&rsquo;s middle and high school system in 1959 and later joined Graff in 1973.</p>
<p>Originally a mathematics and physics teacher in the Springfield school district, Locke became an electrical trades teacher when he started at Graff, just a few years after the school opened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They needed someone to teach the class so I said I would,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Locke continued teaching full-time at Graff and OTC for 36 years. He will remain on staff at OTC as a part-time adjunct faculty member teaching credit and non-credit courses.</p>
<p>Locke, 78, said he has enjoyed training students for the electrical trades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had super-good people who have gone into good careers. A lot of people have gone through here,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>One of those Locke-trained graduates was Lee Beaman of Beaman Electric in Springfield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a mentor to most of the electrical contractors in this area. He is a mentor with a capital M,&rdquo; Beaman said.</p>
<p>Beaman, who attended Graff from 1977-78, said he learned so much from Locke that when Beaman worked for his father in the summer, he would correct his dad sometimes on electrical procedures because of what he learned from Locke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carl&rsquo;s a little old school. His passion for life was his kids. He worked his whole life to make sure they had an opportunity to succeed,&rdquo; Beaman said.</p>
<p>Locke said one of the biggest changes over the years in the electrical trade field has been in the automation area. He said automated controls now allow someone in Hawaii to control the lights in their home in Springfield.</p>
<p>Locke said he&rsquo;s not looking forward to retiring but knows he had it had to happen someday and will leave full-time work with a lot of good memories.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is kind of a family to me here because of the people I work with and all of the students,&rdquo; the confirmed bachelor said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had trying moments and a lot of good moments with good people who got their start here.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>Enrollment in online courses offered by Ozarks Technical Community College exploded in the spring semester, according to figures released this week</p>
<p>More than 1,100 student are taking at least one online OTC course, an increase of 34 percent over last year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The continually impressive growth in online enrollment reflects not only the flexibility and affordability of online education but also the College&rsquo;s responsiveness to student needs and commitment to maximum accessibility and superior quality of instruction,&rdquo; said Witt Salley, director of online teaching and learning at OTC.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the College&rsquo;s online program did not provide high quality or add value to students&rsquo; educational experiences, online enrollments would not continue to increase as they have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Students can now complete programs entirely online in teaching, business and marketing and business technology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;This growth, then, speaks as much to the wide-ranging availability in online course and program offerings and excellence in teaching and learning as it does to online education&rsquo;s convenience and affordability in tough economic times,&rdquo; Salley said.</p>
<p>Randy Humphrey, vice president of academic affairs, said an increase number of students are looking to online offerings when it comes to building their schedules and as a result, Salley and his staff are assisting instructors to expand offerings to meet student demand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As more students become comfortable with the technology and format for online learning, we expect the demand to continue to grow for online classes. &nbsp;The online environment has enabled the college to continue to respond to growth in enrollment in a time when our campus facilities and classrooms are largely filled to capacity,&rdquo; Humphrey said.</p>
<p>Salley said the College is looking to increasing online offerings as aggressively as possible with degrees offered in Health Information Technology and possibly Computer Information Science.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are also proposing a course in project management that will be offered online if approved. From there, we will be researching the feasibility of a certificate or entire degree program in project management. This program could be offered at any of our campuses or education centers, and probably should be, but it is being designed specifically for online delivery,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As new courses and programs are introduced into the college&rsquo;s curriculum, we will carefully plan for delivering them online in order to serve the unique population of students who rely on online education to meet their professional, academic, and personal needs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Overall, OTC&rsquo;s spring enrollment is up 6.9 percent overall from last spring with a total of 10,588 students taking classes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe that half of the increase is based on the hard times we are in and half is due to OTC continuing to meet the needs of people in our service area,&rdquo; said Dr. Hal Higdon, president of OTC.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> &ldquo;I think it shows that when the times are tough, they know that going to a community college is the best thing they can do to improve their lives. More education and training are going to help you.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>The start of fall classes maybe eight weeks away, but there are plenty of opportunities over the next few weeks to discover what&rsquo;s planned for OTC&rsquo;s education campuses and centers next semester.</p>
<p>Open houses have been set starting July 19 and ending Aug. 11 with a special open house at the new OTC Lebanon Center, which will give students and community members a chance to discover what&rsquo;s inside the new facility. Visitors can register for a chance to win an iPad2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The open house dates and times are:</p>
<p>&bull; Richwood Valley: Tuesday, July 19, 9 a.m. &ndash; 6 p.m.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>&bull; Branson: Tuesday, July 26, 10 a.m. &ndash; 2 p.m.</p>
<p>&bull; Waynesville: Wednesday, July 27, 9 a.m. - noon</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>&bull; Lebanon: Thursday, Aug. 11, 9 a.m. &ndash; 6 p.m.</p>
<p>The Lebanon Center is moving from its current location in the Nelson Education Center Aug. 2 to the new facilities at 22360 Highway MM, just south of Interstate 44.</p>
<p>The final touches are being put on Casey Hall, named after Reuben and Mary Lou Casey of San Clemente, Calif., who donated the two buildings and more than 13 acres of land to OTC. The total property is valued at approximately $2.6 million and is the largest gift the college has ever received.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Casey Hall will be home to 13 new classrooms, a student lounge and student services department. A branch of the OTC Bookstore along with a Center for Workforce Development office will also be located in the other building on the campus.</p>
<p>Students can begin registering at the new center starting July 5.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are very excited that the OTC Lebanon facility will be open for fall classes. This should be a great educational addition for the people of Lebanon and Laclede County to use to their advantage. I hope everyone will come to the open house and discover what&rsquo;s there for them,&rdquo; said Dr. Hal Higdon, president of Ozarks Technical Community College.</p>
<p>Jeff Kulbach, director of the Lebanon center, said the staff is eager to begin operations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over the months, we&rsquo;ve been closely involved in the initial planning, design, infill construction and set up of the new buildings. We are very excited to be offering residents a new and expanded classes in this new facility,&rdquo; he said.</p>

                    <SPAN lang=EN>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Lessons learned by college students take place outside the classroom as well as inside as a group of occupational therapy students from OTC recently learned.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Nearly two dozen students traveled to Jefferson City last month to participate in "OT on the Hill Day."</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>This was a day of advocacy sponsored by the Missouri Occupational Therapy Association (MOTA) that included students meeting with legislators to discuss the profession and the impact federal and state health laws impact their chosen profession.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"The OTA students and faculty learned that advocating for the profession of occupational therapy is a vital component of working in todays healthcare market," said Becky Jenkins, program director for OTCs occupational therapy assistant program.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Cameron Biggs, a first year OTA student, said he was hoping to convince legislators to expand Medicare for adults in the state</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"They vote on the laws and they can help us change what happens in our field of work," he said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>All of the students said the experience was eye opening and a great learning experience.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Local state representative Lincoln Hough was really into OTA along with many other legislators who told the students who keep in touch with them.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"They were very receptive. They made us feel like friends. They were not intimidating," said Kyla Fieth, a student from Springfield.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"They wanted to talk to us. They let us tell them about our issues."</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>While most legislators were receptive to the students, some were not, including on representative who told Biggs he should "give up" trying to convince legislators to accept the Affordable Care Act and expand Medicare.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"The most important lesson they learned is that they have a voice and people are listening to what they have to say, even if they are students and do not yet have a lot of experience," Jenkins said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Christy Gorman, a Springfield student, said the group broke the ice with legislators.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"They are people, too," she said.</P></SPAN>

                    <p>&nbsp;Ryan Nicholls has learned a lot about emergency management both inside and outside the classrooms at Ozarks Technical Community College.</p>
<p>Nothing taught him more about his job as Greene County director of emergency management than in May when a tornado devastated Joplin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joplin was a career moment. All the principals of emergency management that we understood were needed on a scale we never imagined. It was on a scale that we were never tested on before Joplin,&rdquo; said Nicholls, who attended OTC and eventually earned his master&rsquo;s degree in emergency management.</p>
<p>Nicholls, the county&rsquo;s director of emergency management for the past five years, came to OTC to get his GED, and in doing so, he earned a scholarship that paid for several semesters of school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OTC helped me get started. It excited me academically and led me to know that I wanted a master&rsquo;s degree,&rdquo; said Nicholls, who is 35, married and the father of five children.</p>
<p>After three semesters at OTC, Nicholls spent two years on a church mission in South America. After returning, Nicholls eventually went on to earn his master&rsquo;s in emergency management.</p>
<p>But it was his time at OTC that Nicholls remembers fondly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got confidence at OTC.&nbsp; I can probably honestly say that the majority of college instructors who standout in my mind were from OTC. They applied the subject to us in a way that made it easier for us to study. There was a motivation to study and we enjoyed doing it,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Nicholls said that what he learned at OTC and in his other academic studies were put to the test with the Joplin tornado.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Analytical thinking, prioritizing, evaluating, problem solving, these are all academic skills learned at OTC,&rdquo; he said.</p>

                    <p>Putting on the iconic play &ldquo;Our Town&rdquo; can be a challenge for any theater troupe but the Ozarks Technical Community College&rsquo;s Fine Arts department is ready to present its version at the end of the month.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a real challenge,&rdquo; said director Jon Herbert. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s exciting. I&rsquo;ve been really stretched and grown a lot through the process of directing this play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul Newman once played the main role, and it is the most produced play in American theatre history. The OTC theater department will have four performances at the Gillioz Theatre &mdash; April 29 and April 30 at 7:30 p.m., May 1 at 2:30 p.m. and May 7 at 7:30 p.m.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our Town&rdquo; centers on the lives in Grovers Corners, a northeast farm community. Narrated by the Stage Manager, &ldquo;Our Town&rdquo; introduces the audience to two families&mdash;the Gibbs and the Webbs&mdash;through whom the serenity of their daily lives, the joining of their children in marriage and the struggle with leaving the world in death is experienced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our Town is anybody&rsquo;s town,&rdquo; Herbert said. &ldquo;Both for the actors on stage and those in the audience. The play will speak to anyone. Everyone will come away with something different from the play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Thornton Wilder&rsquo;s play is a period piece set at the turn of the 20th century, Herbert said, &ldquo;The actors are going to dress as they normally dress today; they will speak in their own speech patterns and move in their own natural rhythms. There are some really magical moments from the cast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herbert said the play would be inspiring and leave people with a good feeling, but also the play issues a serious challenge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I think people will come away reminded of the many opportunities we have to experience how much beauty there is in the world if we only take the time from our busy lives to stop,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Visit www.otc.edu/videofeatures for more insight into &ldquo;Our Town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tickets are $10 and are available at the Gillioz box office or call 863-9491.</p>

<P dir=ltr align=left>Booked for Lunch is a book club open to the local community hosted on the OTC campus. The club invites faculty, staff, students, and the general community to join together to read "The Heart and the Fist: The education of a humanitarian, the making of a Navy SEAL," by Eric Greitens.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Karen Foresee, who is organizing Booked for Lunch, said its the first time faculty, staff and students have been brought together to read a common book.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"Everyone will be on an equal basis to read and to enjoy the book together. We can take a break and find common ground reading," said Foresee, an English instructor at OTC. "Booked for Lunch will create a space to talk about and listen to how reading intersects with our memories, our everyday lives, and current events. Id like to invite anyone interested to join us and become part of a larger community through reading."</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Lyndsey Fronterhouse, an English instructor at the OTC Richwood Valley Campus, was the Colleges representative on the committee established by MSU to choose a book, which will be used for MSU's freshmen class in Fall 2014.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"We researched the success of book reading at other campuses and have found that most have common reader classes," she said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>In the book, Greitens, who is also a Rhodes Scholar, lives in St. Louis and serves as the CEO of The Mission Continues, recounts his life of working with volunteers who taught art of children in Bolivia and who led Marines to hunt terrorists in Iraq. As a Navy SEAL, he fought in Afghanistan. Today, he works with disabled and severely wounded veterans.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Foresee said reading the book will begin in March and be completed before the end of April so it does not interfere with final exams in May. She also said the public is invited to come to the Booked for Lunch meetings.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Foresee and Fronterhouse said there is a chance Greitens will be coming to MSU in the fall to speak. If that happens, OTC readers will be invited to attend the event.</P>

<P>Booked for Lunch's first meeting will be Wednesday, March 5, from noon to 1 p.m. in the Norman K. Myers building, Room 235C. <SPAN lang=EN></P>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>The beauty and precision of Thai dancers will soon grace the Gillioz Theater stage in a performance sponsored by the Fine Arts department of Ozarks Technical Community College.</p>
<p>The Classical Thai Music and Dance Ensemble from the Phrankakhon Rajabhat University of Thailand will perform at 8 p.m. Oct. 26. A one-hour question and answer seminar will begin at 7 p.m. Admission is free.</p>
<p>The 19 dancers and musicians are showcasing Thai culture through music and dance in performances at several Missouri community colleges in addition to OTC, including St. Louis Community College, Crowder College and Mineral Area College.</p>
<p>The dancers will wear the traditional, colorful costumes associated with the Thai-style of dance. They will perform a variety of dances while accompanied by traditional Thai music and songs played with native instruments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;The mission of the International Programs Office is to promote an appreciation of how our students, college and community fit into the global community by encouraging cultural diversity through international student exchange, and enriching the academic experience of our students through internationalization<ins datetime="2009-10-06T16:13" cite="mailto:lundstrl"> </ins>of curriculum and enhanced language programs&rdquo;, said Loren Lundstrom, Assistant Dean for Arts and Letters and Director of International Programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Catherine Clemens, chair of OTC&rsquo;s Arts and Humanities department, said the performance will be of special interest to many of the arts and humanities students, especially those studying in the areas of music, theater and religion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;This presentation applies to our goals by enriching student&rsquo;s experience by engaging and observing the creative process, learning about the global landscape and different cultures, lessons will be addressed that cover the cultural worldviews, and the interconnectedness of people around the world,&rdquo; she said.</p>

		<title>OTC CEC instructor publishes 10th recipe book</title>

                    <P>J.E. Cornwell has taken his talents in both cooking and publishing to offer readers an inside look into the secrets behind some of the popular dishes offered in the Ozarks.</P>
<P>Cornwell, who teaches classes at the OTC Community Enrichment Center, is releasing &nbsp;"What's Cookin' Local," a compilation of more than 130 recipes including more than 70 videos, from restaurant including Hemingway's and Gem of India to the Tower Club and Caspers.</P>
<P>Cornwell, who had run a restaurant in the Kansas City area before turning to publishing, has been publishing recipe books featuring restaurant recipes for 12 years.</P>
<P>"I did a Kansas City restaurants book in 2004," he said. "I did the first "Taste of Springfield" book in 2008 with about 40 or 50 local spots in it. This one is my 10th recipe book."</P>
<P>One of those books was a national project call "A Taste of Main Street America," which featured recipes from restaurants located on cities' Main Streets.</P>
<P>"It was quite an undertaking. It really burned me out and I hadn't done anything since until this book," he said.</P>
<P>The book comes in a number of formats. It's available on Cornwell's Web site at <A href="www.recipepubs.com"><U>www.recipepubs.com</U></A>, on a CD and on a flash drive. The book includes recipes and a large number of video instructions.</P>
<P>The book is broken into sections by recipe type including: appetizers, beverages, soups, salads and sandwiches, entrees, miscellaneous and desserts.</P>
<P>The recipes include: Dublin's Pass Reuben egg rolls, Galloway Station's patty melt, Gilardi's Chicken Piccata and Nonna's Italian Café's Eggplant Milano.</P>
<P>Cornwell said there were some restaurants that didn't want to disclose certain recipes.</P>
<P>"The ingredients were secret or they were actually copying a recipe from another restaurant," he said.</P>
<P>A book signing party, featuring some of the chefs who participated in the project, will be held Aug. 4 at 6 p.m. at Saviello's Sweet &amp; Savory Catering, 1701 S. Fort, located in the Mansion at Elfindale.</P>
<P>Cornwell said if you can't make the signing but have tried the recipe, it's good to pass that on to the restaurants.</P>
<P>"Tell a chef or any owner if you tried a recipe from the book," he said. "They will love to hear it."</P>

		<title>OTC choir program expanding in the fall</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
                    
                    <p>The popularity of the Ozarks Technical Community College choir has grown so much over the past several years that it will be expanding in the fall.</p>
<p>Kathryn Cole, the choir&rsquo;s director, said a new ensemble choir will be established as an addition to the larger Concert Choir. The smaller-sized ensemble choir will be made up of members who will sing a cappella (singing without musical accompaniment).</p>
<p>This past spring, the Concert Choir had 25 members, more than double the number the choir had just three years ago when Cole took over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People are finally realizing we have a program and want to be a part of it. They hear us at school functions, commencements and picnics. The word is out and kids are excited to tell their friends about the choir,&rdquo; Cole said.</p>
<p>Jennifer McAtee, lead instructor for the OTC music department and the piano accompanist at the concerts, said a lot of hard work has gone into making the choir a success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have worked on visibility with our performances. President (Hal) Higdon has helped us a lot. Seeing his support and that of the rest of the administration really helps others spread the word about the choirs,&rdquo; McAtee said.</p>
<p>While picnics have been good performance venues, they have also served at the site for choir auditions, which have become more selective.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It used to be that we would take anybody. Now, it&rsquo;s not just anybody,&rdquo; McAtee said.</p>
<p>Cole agreed, adding that &ldquo;southwest Missouri is rich in choral talent and we have students coming to us from schools that have great musical programs. They can continue to sing at OTC and not have to wait until they get to a four-year college.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cole, who has been singing since high school and graduated from Evangel University with her bachelor&rsquo;s in music education and earned a master&rsquo;s from Missouri State University, said she hopes that the addition of the second choir will help build momentum for the program.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone is becoming aware of the program. Attendance is up at the concerts and the program is growing; it&rsquo;s not shrinking,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p><em>Steve Koehler is coordinator of media relations at Ozarks Technical Community College.</em></p>

                    <P>The joke goes something like this:</P>
<P>Question: "How do you get to Carnegie Hall?"</P>
<P>Answer: "Practice."</P>
<P>The OTC Concert Choir has done plenty of practicing and as a result, about a dozen members will perform with other collegiate choirs in Carnegie Hall this spring.</P>
<P>"It's a blessing," said Kathryn Cole, director of the OTC choirs.</P>
<P>It will be the second-straight year OTC will be represented on the national stage. </P>
<P>Last spring, the colleges vocal ensembles were invited to participate in the Distinguished Concerts International New York Concert Series. </P>
<P>During that visit, the choirs performed in Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center.</P>
<P>This trip is again put on by the Distinguished Concerts organization, but this time, the choirs will sing two pieces in the Stern Auditorium/Perelman Stage at Carnegie Hall.</P>
<P>The concert is entitled "The Drop of Dawn" and is composed by Christopher Tin, the hall's composer in residence. </P>
<P>The two selections the choir will sing are "Calling All Dawns" and "The Drop that Contained the Sea."</P>
<P>Cole said the invitation is a reward for the hard work the choir put in.</P>
<P>"We have a high turnover in the choir because we are a two-year institution but some students stay on several semesters because they don't want to leave," she said. "There are students who have said they wouldn't have graduated if not for the choir."</P>
<P>Cole said last year's trip allowed students to have a change to perform with others from all over the country.</P>
<P>"The students get to see how what they have talent-wise stacks up to others," she said. "They are challenged by those at a higher level. It is an artistic refreshment for me."</P>
<P></P>
<P>Cole said the students will have to raise money for the trip that will take place April 10-14. The concert is April 13 at 8:30 p.m. Eastern Time.</P>
<P>Fund-raising activities will be announced later in the year. Those who want to contribute directly can contact Cole at <A href="mailto:colek@otc.edu"><U>colek@otc.edu</U></A>.</P>
<P>The choirs will be performing its Christmas concert at the Springfield Art Museum Dec. 3 at 7 p.m.</P>
<P></P>

                    <P>Start spreading the news  the Ozarks Technical Community College Concert Choir and Chamber Singers are heading to New York City.</P>
<P>The college's vocal ensembles have been invited to participate in the Distinguished Concerts International New York Concert Series to be held Memorial Day weekend, which includes performing in Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center.</P>
<P></P>
<P>OTC's members will join other choirs studying with world-renowned composer and conductor Mark Hayes, culminating with the world premier performance of Hayes' "Requiem."</P>
<P></P>
<P>"This prestigious invitation is an incredible learning opportunity for our students.&nbsp;It's an event our students will never forget. They will grow as musicians by learning to perform with others they have never met," said OTC choir director Kathryn Cole.</P>
<P>&nbsp;OTCs concert choir is a 30-member ensemble and the chamber singers are 15 members selected from the concert choir. The students are working to raise the $1,600 needed for each student to attend the five-day event.</P>
<P>Cole said they hope to raise enough money for 10-15 students to make the trip.</P>
<P></P>
<P>This invitation is significant, Cole said, because it is the first time a choral ensemble from Springfield has been hand-selected to sing at Avery Fischer Hall at Lincoln Center.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Kat Allie, department chair of the Fine Arts and Humanities department, said she was proud of the students and faculty involved in the project.</P>
<P>"As a Fine Arts department, we continue to grow and flourish, but the focus on our students and the importance of providing them outstanding opportunities such as performing at the Lincoln Center in New York City makes us one of the best schools for students looking to follow their passions and attain their educational goals.&nbsp; We lay the groundwork and then elevate, " she said.</P>
<P>A number of fundraisers are scheduled to help defray the trip's cost. They include:</P>
<P>Feb. 11 at Pizza Inn, 1425 W. Battlefield from 6-8 p.m.</P>
<P> March 4 at Qdoba, 401 S. Kimbrough from 5-9 pm.</P>
<P>To make a direct contribution, contact Cole at <A href="mailto:colek@otc.edu"><U>colek@otc.edu</U></A> or at (417) 501-9430.</P>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Thousands of volunteers helped construct an amazing new home for the Niki and Chris Hampton family near Ash Grove that will be featured on the &ldquo;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition&rdquo; television show in the fall.</p>
<p>Among those working away were a number of folks from Ozarks Technical Community College, including David Aderhold, chair of the construction management department at OTC. Aderhold is a good friend of Sam Clifton of Millstone Custom Homes, whose company was selected to build the house.</p>
<p>Aderhold was called to join Clifton&rsquo;s management team that oversaw the project because the two have known each other for a long time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done a little bit of everything, kind of a jack of all trades, so Sam called me,&rdquo; said Aderhold, who has been with OTC since its inception and before with Graff Vo-Tech.</p>
<p>Other OTC volunteers, like Kristin Farish, administrative assistant to public relations and grants development, pitched in anyway they could to help make the house become a reality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ran bottled water to workers, carried lumber, picked up rocks and helped put a 32-foot beam in place. We wanted to get our hands dirty,&rdquo; Farish said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was awesome. There were all these worker ants. It ran like clockwork. Everybody was upbeat and having a good time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For Aderhold, who was at the site since about 14 hours a day, he did everything from helping set up the blast that took down the family&rsquo;s one-bedroom farmhouse to performing any task that needed to be done to get the project finished.</p>
<p>Proudly wearing a hardhat autographed by the stars of the television program, including one from Ty Pennington, the show&rsquo;s host, Aderhold said he was amazed how smoothly everything went.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the trades were working together. There were 75 framers instead of the normal four or five. There were 100 dry wallers. Electricians, plumbers were all working together at the same time, shoulder to shoulder. It looked like a well-orchestrated ballet,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Aderhold was especially proud to see some graduates from OTC trades programs on the site working. Some worked for other companies; others had started their own businesses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was really neat to see them apply their trades out here,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>In the end, the Hampton family of eight got a new home, thanks to everyone&rsquo;s efforts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s lots of love out here,&rdquo; Aderhold said.</p>
<p><em>Steve Koehler is the coordinator of publications at Ozarks Technical Community College.</em></p>

                    <SPAN lang=EN>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Jo Fritts and her husband, Steve, both instructors at OTC, have been associated with the college's Alpha Psi Tau chapter of Phi Theta Kappa chapter for so long that its hard to remember when they werent involved in some way with the honors society.</P>
<P>And their work continues to increase and produce great dividends for the college and the society's members.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Earlier this year, Jo was named as one of the societys Faculty Scholars, and last spring, she was designated the regional coordinator for PTK. Steve was named the associate coordinator.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"We are now advisors for the Missouri region for all 26 chapters in the area. We are the contact people and we handle all the issues, problems and questions anyone has. We also plan the regional conference and events," she said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>PTK is the only honors society for community college students and requires a 3.50 grade point average with 12 credit hours of work.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Jo was first involved in PTK as a student when she attended Johnson County Community College in 1990. When she came to OTC in 1997, she was asked if she would be interested in helping form a chapter at the college.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"Steve just came a long and got involved with me," she said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Steve downplays his role when he first started assisting his wife.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"At the time, I was working as an adjunct at OTC, and since Jo and I do everything together, it was natural for me to assist. I became known as the punch boy for my punch making skills at inductions," he said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Jos work has earned the college chapter dozens of prestigious awards including most distinguished chapter in Missouri four years straight and the distinguished college president award given to OTC Chancellor Dr. Hal L. Higdon.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"Jo took over the Alpha Psi Tau chapter at a time when it was losing its charter due to inactivity.We have grown to be the largest chapter in Missouri under Jos leadership," Steve said.</P>
<P>Jo said she is pushing to improve the region because Missouri is the state where PTK originated in 1918 at Stephens College.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"I am trying to build the pride in PTK back in Missouri. We should be the top region. Right now were not, so we need to get that pride back and we will," she said.</P><I>

		<title>OTC dental students head to Nicaragua</title>

                    <P>OTC dental students are getting an intense lesson in providing patient care this week as they treat hundreds of poor villagers in a small Nicaraguan village.</P>
<P>Six dental students and four dental program alumni, along with several faculty members and other supporters are in Nicaragua this week as part of dental mission trip organized by Rebecca Caceras, OTCs dental hygiene program director.</P>
<P>The students and support staff are expected to treat 500 residents who live in a rural area of the country and who either don't have access to dental treatment or can't afford it. The residents will not be charged for the services.</P>
<P>"Dental care is not a high priority for those living there. They don't have the money. It's more about buying beans and rice to eat. Healthcare is a low priority," Caceras said.</P>
<P>The group will bring two Nicaraguan dentists and one physician on the trip to assist with some of the care given. The group expects to treat about 100 a day for five days before returning home this weekend.</P>
<P>Caceras is familiar with the plight of the people in the area the group will visit. She did missionary work there for four years before joining the OTC staff and met her husband, Jose, there where he worked as a dentist.</P>
<P>All of those going on the trip are paying their own way with money raised through donations and fundraisers.</P>
<P>"The students will receive some cultural awareness and a better understanding of providing dental care and health care in a new environment. It will be triage dentistry in someone's home. We will also work in churches and community buildings," she said.</P>
<P>Two dental hygiene students who are going on the trip said they were looking forward to the trip that will take them out of the country for the first time.</P>
<P>"It's my first dental mission and I think it will be a great learning experience seeing 500 people as well as my first time out of the country," said Emily Swyder, a first year student.</P>
<P>Tiffany Smith said shes always wanted to take a mission trip.</P>
<P>"I know I will learn a lot in addition to providing dental help to a lot of people who dont have an opportunity to get it on a regular basis," she said.</P><I>

                    <p>The season of giving is fast approaching and several groups at Ozarks Technical Community College are preparing to do their part to help those less fortunate.</p>
<p>OTC&lsquo;s Classified Staff organization is selecting up to five OTC student families who need assistance. Different campus departments will adopt the families and provides gifts, clothing, money and possibly food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ask that the families provide a list of their needs so we can try to meet their requests,&rdquo; said Victoria Ramey, president of the OTC Classified Staff.</p>
<p>Ramey, her eyes filling with tears, said the letters from those in need are hard to read.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a lot of loss in my life. I was an at-risk person myself. I appreciate family and people. I wish I could do more,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The families include a student who is caring for his ill elderly mother who recently had surgery. Another student is raising two children on her own and is in need of clothes for the kids.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel like I&rsquo;m the conduit for goodness. I try to connect those who can help with those who are in need of help,&rdquo; Ramey said.</p>
<p>Several student groups are combining efforts to help others.</p>
<p>The Professional Land Care Network student organization along with the Spanish Club are collecting eyeglasses for the children of Mexico and are also gathering money and toys for Joplin residents.</p>
<p>Terri Howard, president of PLANET, said the glasses will be fixed before being sent to Mexico for distribution to children there.</p>
<p>Howard said since this is the first Christmas since the tornado hit Joplin in the spring, her group wanted to help make the holiday better with the toy and spare change collections.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are a lot of kids who don&rsquo;t have their toys any more,&rdquo; Howard said.</p>
<p><em>Steve Koehler is coordinator of media relations at Ozarks Technical Community College.</em></p>

                    <SPAN lang=EN>
<P dir=ltr align=left>OTC employees got an up close and personal look at what poverty looks like in the Ozarks.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>OACAC's Poverty Simulation, brought to the Springfield campus by the colleges student services department, put OTC employees in the roles of low-income family members living on limited budgets and with other limited means of support.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Participants had four 15-minute sessions, each representing a week, in which they simulated real-life situations encountered by those living in poverty</P>
<P></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Meghan Visor, program development specialist for OACAC, said the participants faced a number of challenges those in a low-income situation face everyday, including gaining help from social service groups, utility companies and schools.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"This simulation really doesn't represent the lower end of the poverty line but the simulations are real, not a game", she said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Joan Barrett, OTC associate vice chancellor for student services, said the simulation provided OTC staff with an opportunity to walk the walk.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"We know intellectually some of barriers our students living in poverty face, but experiencing a bit first hand helped to galvanize some of the real challenges," she said. "This exercise helped us to relate, on a very human level, some of the day to day challenges of some of our own students."</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Chelsea Taylor, an OTC admissions representative, said she was expecting the event to be more of a game. </P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"But as you're getting frustrated with the simulated life circumstances, there's a point where it registers that its an everyday struggle for many people in this community," she said. </P>
<P></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"As I got further into the simulation, feelings of desperation and hopelessness came over me .It was very difficult to deal with the time constraints and limited resources."</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Loren Lundstrom, dean of student development, said exercise demonstrated that poverty creates additional issues that have a snowball effect.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"They quickly escalate into insurmountable obstacles. For our college students living in poverty, a strong support network needs to be in place to ensure they succeed," he said. "I'm confident we have that type of support across-campus at OTC."</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Visser said she's sure the simulation got the intended message across to the participants.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"The struggles people go through are real," she said. "The exercise usually opens some eyes."</P>

                    <SPAN lang=EN>
<P dir=ltr align=left>The start of the fall semester at OTC also means the start of new art exhibits at the OTC Fine Arts Galley in the Gillioz Theater.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>This Friday, the new season kicks off on the third floor of the Gillioz with works from Melissa Szymanski, who was the Best of Show artist at the 2011 Art Walks 10<SUP>th</SUP> anniversary juried exhibition.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"Melissa's work, done in colored pencil, is undeniably impressive in technique and her original thought and expressions are uniquely refreshing. In this brand new series of work, Melissa has explored the two-dimensional aspects of drawing while infusing elements of collage and three-dimensional surfaces," said Kat Allie, the colleges department chair for Fine Arts and Humanities and gallery manager.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Also featured during the September Art Walk, on the first floor of the Gillioz, will be student drawings and paintings that were created by students during the recent summer studio art courses.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>The first month of Art Walk is just the start to what Allie sees as a busy time at the Gillioz, where she will be striving to incorporate all areas of the fine arts in the monthly exhibitions.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>In October, the gallery will again be hosting and featuring the annual Art Walk juried exhibition that will allow visitors to vote for the People's Choice award-winning piece.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>A student showcase will be held later in the year, which gives students the opportunity to interact with the hundreds of visitors who come to see their work. Allie said its a great learning experience for the students.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"They are asked to produce something that is gallery-ready and that's hanging in a official gallery where a lot of people will view it. It adds to their exhibition list. They get to be a part of the reception. They get a chance to explain the content of their work and utilize the formal vocabulary of the arts and verbalize with the visitor," Allie said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>A faculty exhibit is planned for February, and April will feature works selected for area high schools.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>In addition, the popular Community Wishing Wall will be on display at the Art Walk events. The large reproduction of Van Goghs Starry Night is painted on corrugated board. Visitors are invited to write a wish on a piece of colored paper and insert it into a hole in the painting with the small color.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>There are thousands of holes in the painting and the work is expected to be filled later this month.</P>

                    <p>Summer vacation is over and that means the OTC Fine Arts Gallery will reopen tonight for First Friday Art Walk as it embarks on an ambitious season of exhibits and presentations.</p>
<p>Located on the third floor of the Gillioz Theater in downtown Springfield, the gallery will present &ldquo;Art as Therapy: Therapy as Art&rdquo; by Cassie Dennis-Elson and Rachel Nelson. Both women are trained counselors who use art as a tool to communicate with clients about feelings and emotions.</p>
<p>Kathlene Allie, OTC art instructor and manager of the gallery, said the exhibit was designed to inform visitors, especially students, about art therapy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are a lot of students interested in art therapy or music therapy as a major. Finding places offering such classes are hard to find. I knew Cassie and Rachel would be here for the exhibit,&rdquo; Allie said, who has known Dennis-Elson, a Springfield native, for several years.</p>
<p>Students and other guests will be able to meet and talk to Dennis-Elson and Nelson at the gallery from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. today.</p>
<p>Following tonight&rsquo;s premiere, the gallery will be open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Thursday and from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Fridays, except for First Friday events, when the gallery will remain open until 10 p.m.</p>
<p>Allie said visitors can look forward to a number of other interesting exhibits for upcoming Art Walks, which are held on the first Friday of the month.</p>
<p>In October, there will be a show of visual, musical and theatrical work by OTC&rsquo;s full-time and adjunct faculty.</p>
<p>In November, an exhibit of photographs by Clarrisa French is scheduled for the gallery. French is a former editor of the Springfield Business Journal and, for the last three years, has worked as communications director for the Art Walk.</p>
<p>In December and May, OTC art students will present their visual, musical and theatrical works.</p>
<p>Allie said the gallery and the students are helping get the word out that the OTC Fine Arts program is growing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are teaching people that we are here. It&rsquo;s a real program,&rdquo; Allie said.</p>

                    <DIR>
<P>Like some students when they first come to Ozarks Technical Community College, Jordan Morgan wasn't sure what career he was most interested in.</P>
<P>But now, he's sure he's made the right choice.</P>
<P>In May, Morgan graduated with a degree in Computer Information Science. And today, he is the proud developer, creator and owner of a mobile device app that's peaked to No. 18 worldwide in finance apps from the iOS App Store.</P>
<P>The app is called Spend Stack and costs $1.99. It designed to help a person know exactly what he or she is spending by calculating local tax rates and keeping a running total of the sales price and the exact taxes owed as items are added to a shopping list.</P>
<P>"My wife and I tried to budget out money and we were always a little over or under of what we budgeted because of all the different tax rates that were applied depending on where you shopped," Morgan said.</P>
<P>As part of developing the app, Morgan started his own business called Dreaming In Binary, online at <A href="http://www.dreaminginbinary.co/index.html"><U>dreaminginbinary.co</U></A>.</P>
<P>Morgan was able to retrieve all the various sales tax rates from tax offices around the country and compiled them into his app. Last week, it peaked at No. 18.</P>
<P>"It was awesome. I was out with my wife and I looked at the category and I was shocked," he said. "The best part is to see people use it. Folks email me with how they like it."</P>
<P>The app took about a year to develop and create. He credits OTC's CIS program for giving him the know-how on developing such devices.</P>
<P>"I've always been a big fan of the CIS department. When we graduate, we are battle tested. At OTC, we get in and do it. OTC equipped me with the know-how."</P>
<P>Tiffany Ford, chair of the CIS department, said Morgan was the kind of student the program wanted.</P>
<P>"He was really motivated and driven to succeed," she said. "He not only really applied himself in his classes but he started putting his new skills he was learning to outside projects immediately."</P>
<P>Morgan, who attended Trinity Christian School in Hollister before coming to OTC, is working at what he calls his dream job as a program and developer for HealthMEDX in Ozark.</P>
<P>Now that he's tasted success in the app development world, he's not about to slow down.</P>
<P>"I've got thousands of ideas for apps," he said.</P></DIR>

		<title>OTC grad now works for Kenny Chesney</title>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Phil Robinson, top sound operator for country-music superstar Kenny Chesney, has not forgotten his Ozarks Technical Community College roots.</p>
<p>Robinson, originally from Clever, returned to the College Monday to pick up his diploma that he failed to get when he graduated in 1994 with an Associate of Applied Science in Electronic Media Production, one of the most popular programs now offered at the College.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything I know I learned at OTC,&rdquo; said Robinson, who now lives in Orlando, Fla., and who has worked for Chesney for more than eight years.</p>
<p>The 35-year-old Robinson, who was awarded one of the first scholarships ever given by the College, received an empty diploma holder without the official document in it in the College&rsquo;s graduation ceremony.</p>
<p>He left right after the service to go to his job in Branson where he worked for a few years as a sound engineer for a variety of shows including Roy Clark, Jim Stafford and Doug Gabriel.</p>
<p>From Branson, Robinson moved to Florida to work for Universal Studios in setting up sound for nightclubs there. A friend he met there went to work for the musical group Alabama and then for Chesney. The friend eventually called Robinson to go to work with him and Chesney.</p>
<p>As a monitor engineer, Robinson is responsible for mixing the sounds of all the singers and musicians and transmitting that signal to the earpieces Chesney and the other performers wear.</p>
<p>Robinson must continually monitor the sound and watch Chesney for signals to increase or decrease specific instruments or voices as the star requests changes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud to be a part of the tour,&rdquo; Robinson said, explaining that Chesney is the No. 1 act on tour in all musical genres because &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all about the fact that (fans) can let go of life and their problems for two hours. They don&rsquo;t have to worry about anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robinson&rsquo;s return to the College allowed him to enjoy a reunion with one of his favorite instructors, Robert Gustad, who taught Robinson both at Clever High School and at the College. Gustad still teaches at the College.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Phil&rsquo;s personal initiation and drive that made him a success. We teach the skills and if they have the personality and drive, it will get them a job,&rdquo; Gustad said.</p>
<p>The work can be grueling but Robinson enjoys every minute of it.</p>
<p>Traveling with up to 18 buses and 12 semi-tractor trailers, Robinson and the others in the crew start setting up for a show in the morning, doing sound checks about 3:45 p.m. and tearing down after the concert. They finish about 3 a.m.</p>
<p>The equipment is loaded and the crew hits the road, driving 200-400 miles to the next venue. The tour has played all over the U.S. and a few times in Canada and Mexico.</p>
<p>Because of Chesney&rsquo;s popularity and success in the U.S., Robinson said the star sees no need to go anywhere else.</p>
<p>Robinson also travels with Chesney when he appears on television programs like &ldquo;Ellen,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Today Show&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&rdquo; to assist with sound issues.</p>
<p>Robinson has met all sorts of famous people from presidents to Paul McCartney. He has been to the White House several times and got a Christmas card from President Bush this year.</p>
<p>The College has changed quite a bit since Robinson graduated nearly 15 years ago. The Information Commons buildings were not built yet when he attended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This place is huge. It has really grown,&rdquo; said Robinson, who comes home for Christmas every year to be with his parents and brother, who still live in Clever.</p>
<p>And now Robinson has an OTC diploma, presented to him Monday by Joan Barrett, dean of students and registrar, to put under the Christmas tree this year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind of nice to have something actually in (the holder),&rdquo; he said flashing the diploma proudly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I came back for it. I did it for mama and for me.&rdquo;</p>

                    <P>When Michael Horn says he took the long road to earn his degree in culinary arts at OTC, he's not exaggerating.</P>
<P>Horn, a Jefferson City resident, traveled the 130-mile trip from the state capital to Springfield every Monday at 4:30 a.m., spent four or five days in classes and then drove home to share the weekend with his wife and three boys.</P>
<P>He did it for two years.</P>
<P>Now, he is a line cook at Sapphire's Restaurant at the DoubleTree Hotel in Jefferson City and embarking on starting his own catering business.</P>
<P>"I enjoyed it. I was dedicated to driving it for two years. I didn't mind," said Horn, 43, who stayed with his father-in-law in Republic while going to school at OTC from 2010 to 2012.</P>
<P>Horn's start at a catering service got a big shot in the arm recently when he catered Sen. Bob Dixon's inaugural reception. </P>
<P>"One of Sen. Dixon's assistants works with my wife, Stephanie, part-time and knew that I graduated from OTC. She asked if I would do it. I was nervous but I cooked it at my house for about 25 people. I did lunch at hors d'oeuvres.</P>
<P>Sen. Dixon was impressed with the food and Horns story.</P>
<P>"I enjoyed him and his family. The food was excellent and I was moved by his story and perseverance. We had a lot of compliments from the legislative staff who said Mike's food was better than they got in some Greek restaurants," Sen. Dixon said.</P>
<P>Horns offerings included gyros, wild rice, stuffed mushrooms, spinach and artichoke dip, stuffed peppers and baklava. Horn said he excels in pastry and baking.</P>
<P>"I'm still getting calls about the food from people at the capitol," he said. He has an April event for 300 guests coming up.</P>
<P>Horn was a factory worker when he decided to change careers and study culinary arts. His only experience at cooking was helping his mother in the kitchen.</P>
<P>But Horn said the chefs at OTC taught him the skills and gave him the discipline he needed to be qualified to work in a restaurant kitchen.</P>
<P>"They set high standards and challenged me to make my dishes better. All of them help me to high standards. Coming into my position at the restaurant here, I almost felt over-qualified compared to others," he said.</P>

                    <SPAN lang=EN>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Chris Davis remembers the exact moment when he knew he wanted to work in the world of sound effects.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Davis, now 28, was a senior at Ozark High School and studying in the band room for a science final. A DVD movie of Lord of the Rings was playing.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"It showed how they did the sound effects for the movie. I pushed my science book aside and was mesmerized by what I was watching. I knew that was what I wanted to do," Davis said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>That was nine years ago. Today, Davis is just days away from attending one of this weekend's Emmy Awards ceremonies in Los Angeles after being nominated for&nbsp;the prestigious award for his sound editing work on the Paul Simon documentary "Under African Skies," a film about Simons return to Africa years after releasing his cutting-edge album "Graceland."</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Davis, who graduated from OTC with a degree in electronic media production in 2005, has been on the East Coast working in sound effects for the past four years. He works for Deluxe Digital in New York City but also does freelance sound work.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>His work on "Under African Skies" was a freelance piece he did for a studio where he had worked before.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Davis added sound effects to the film where needed. The documentary has scenes shot outdoors and there was little sound recorded with the shots. Davis added the necessary sounds.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Davis said sound work, if it's good, is transparent and goes unnoticed by the untrained ear.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"If someone notices the sound effects, youre not doing your job right," he said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Davis said his time spent at OTC studying electronic media production prepared him for his career and "guided me even more so to what I wanted to do."</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"I had great motivation from my teachers and they had the experience in their various field that I could draw on," he said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Davis admits hes getting more excited as next month's awards ceremony approaches. The ceremony is Saturday. A win would be a great resume builder, he said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"I'm hoping just the nomination would add to my credentials. Being a young editor, it's hard sometimes to get work, I'm trying to prove myself and maybe after this, the jobs will start rolling in," he said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P><I>

		<title>OTC graduates first Middle College students</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
                    
                    <p>The unique Middle College program at Ozarks Technical Community College, designed to give high-school students a chance to change their lives, will graduate its first class this week.</p>
<p>A total of 20 students will receive diplomas from Middle College, created to help with Springfield R-12 school district&rsquo;s high-school dropout rate, targets underachieving students who have the potential to excel, giving them an opportunity to prepare themselves for a post-graduation life.</p>
<p>For Chris Cooper, the program did more than just change his life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe it saved my life. If not for this, I would be on some side street still on drugs, drinking, out of school,&rdquo; said Chris, who was attending Parkview High School before coming to OTC two years ago.</p>
<p>Now, Chris will attend OTC and continue his studies in Diesel/Automotive Technology, one of the three areas the Middle College offers the specially selected students, in addition to Early Childhood Development and Medical Services.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The program is designed for students who are behind in school or have life circumstances whereby the traditional high school is not as suitable.&nbsp; These are bright kids and through assessment have demonstrated a high potential to do college level work.&nbsp; We will provide them with a lot of resources on campus to give them a leg up, but we will also insist they step up their own expectations for learning,&rdquo; said Dr. LaRaine Bauer, Middle College coordinator at OTC.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes, simply by taking them and dropping them into an adult-oriented college environment, students begin to take school more seriously and learning becomes relevant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what helped Ashlyn Seyler, a Central High School student who will graduate from the Middle College on May 16 at a 6 p.m. ceremony at the Gillioz Theater.</p>
<p>Ashlyn hated high school. She didn&rsquo;t like getting up in the morning for classes.</p>
<p>But when she heard about the Middle College program, the only one of its kind in the state, Ashlyn took a closer look and applied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I want to get up in the morning. I want to succeed. I want to be in school,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The program is being conducted in partnership with the Springfield school district. It&rsquo;s funded in part with grants from the Community Foundation of the Ozarks, the Missouri Department of Economic Development, and the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.</p>
<p>While the Middle College is designed to assist students that are struggling in high school, this program addresses the needs of students that are historically underserved or lack access to higher education.</p>
<p>Bauer said the students&rsquo; internships are critical to the success of the program.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The internship component makes us unique. After they earn their diploma, they can enter the workforce with some valuable skills or continue in higher education and stay with us or go on to get their four-year degree,&rdquo; Bauer said.</p>
<p>Jennifer Payne, who made the president&rsquo;s list and is a member of Phi Theta Kappa&rsquo;s honor society, said she never thought she&rsquo;d be so successful and plans to enroll in college.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d be a failure or a dropout. Middle College has changed my life 100 percent,&rdquo; she said.</p>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>It may have taken William Huitt 40 years to get his accounting degree but he said the wait was worth it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just did it for me,&rdquo; said the 69-year-old Springfieldian, who was one of 421 at Ozarks Technical Community College students who participated in Thursday night&rsquo;s commencement exercise at JQH Arena.</p>
<p>A total of 1,222 students graduated between the summer 2008 semester and the summer 2009 semester.</p>
<p>Huitt, a retired office administrator with a local uniform company, said he decided to return to school after a 40-year hiatus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t looking for anything particularly special. I was just determined to do it. It&rsquo;s a very special day for me,&rdquo; said Huitt, who had family from California and Vermont in the audience to watch him receive his degree.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Thousands of family members and friends filled the arena to watch the graduates receive their degrees. With some wearing mortarboards that read: &ldquo;I did it!&rdquo; or decorated with the outline of a giant tooth, graduates were greeted with cheers, blaring air horns and shouts of jubilation from the audience.</p>
<p>Jasmine Whittler, who received her associate of arts degree, will be heading of the Missouri Highway Patrol Academy now, where she will train for six months to become a patrol officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came to OTC because I didn&rsquo;t have much money. This is a great place because you get to know the teachers. It&rsquo;s great to be finally done,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Kurtis Ratliff, who received his technical degree in Electronic Media Production, said he decided to come to OTC because of its reputation for offering &ldquo;hands-on&rdquo; programs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Other colleges like to talk theories but here you can pout your hands on the cameras and computers. It was a great experience,&rdquo; said Ratliff, who already has a job at a local television station.</p>
<p>The graduates and audience heard an inspiring speech from Dr. Robert Spence, longtime president of Evangel University, who told the graduates that despite what&rsquo;s going on around them right now, &ldquo;there is hope. There is hope for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There's hope for people willing to recognize the possibilities and who reject what I would call genetic determinism. That is to say, 'Well, nobody in my family has ever done that. I cannot do it either.' Each of you represents a unique story. You need to remain committed and faithful to your goal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lena Culp, vice president of Phi Theta Kappa, told the audience that many of the graduates had to juggle school, work, a family and other duties while working through school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We learned to lean on those we hold dear,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Many of those people are here today to share in that celebration.&rdquo;</p>

                    <!-- @font-face {   font-family: "Cambria"; }@font-face {   font-family: "American Typewriter"; }p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal { margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: "Times New Roman"; }a:link, span.MsoHyperlink { color: blue; text-decoration: underline; }a:visited, span.MsoHyperlinkFollowed { color: purple; text-decoration: underline; }div.Section1 { page: Section1; } -->
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Ozarks Technical Community College and a collaboration of civic, community and business leaders are joining together on a project that will educate students while improving a local neighborhood.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;Project CoRE soon will begin construction of a home on North Clay Avenue that will give both OTC construction technology students and at-risk youth from the Division of Youth Services an opportunity to learn hands-on in a construction-related environment.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;David Lowry, a construction faculty member at OTC, said it has been a dream of his for many years to get at-risk students involved in such a project.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been in the planning for a couple of years. I taught these kids for 10 years in smaller projects and it&rsquo;s been very successful,&rdquo; he said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;The city of Springfield obtained a grant from the federal Housing and Urban Development to pay for the work although contributions are being sought for a contingency fund. Students from both OTC and youth services will received class credit and a small hourly wage for their work that will include landscaping, sheet rocking, tiling, putting up siding and other basic carpentry work.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;The 1,500-square-foot home, which is expected to cost about $95,000 to build, will sit on one of two empty lots the city of Springfield owns and will have a number of green elements to it to make it energy efficient.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Another home is expected to be built on the second lot sometime in the future. The Urban Neighborhoods Alliance will sell the houses.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;Bob Horton, executive director for UNA, said the new house will have a very positive impact on the neighborhood.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span>&ldquo;A lot of time, projects like these have a domino effect on a neighborhood. &nbsp;When people see a house being built or rehabbed, they make an effort to do the same to their project. Projects like these help to raise the owner-occupied rate in a neighborhood,&rdquo; Horton said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span>The students will work on the house under supervision by local trade businesses and it is expected to be completed in late fall.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span>Those interested in contributing toward the project can contact Horton at 886-4774. More about the project can be found on the UNA website at <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span><a href="http://www.unaonline.org/ProjectCoRE.php">www.unaonline.org/ProjectCoRE.php</a></span></span> </span></p>

		<title>OTC helps bring AED to Crosslines</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
                    
                    <P>With more than 51,000 people using Crosslines every year, the Springfield charity organization never knows when a serious medical issue like a heart attack could arise among their clients.</P>
<P>Now, thanks to OTC, their concerns are greatly eased.</P>
<P>On Sept. 8, Crosslines, which helps families in the crisis situations, will receive an arterial defibrillator and its staff will undergo AED/CPR training.</P>
<P>"Crosslines is so grateful for the donation of the AED from OTC," said Tom Faulkner, director of Crosslines. "By having the AED and all of our staff trained in its use, we now know that if a medical emergency occurs, we have the knowledge and a valuable tool to help us save a life."</P>
<P>OTC is getting the device - valued at $2,250 - from its supplier, Marelly AEDs and First Aid of Chesterfield, Mo.</P>
<P>"We realize money doesn't grow on trees. The name of the game is saving lives," said Chip George, owner of Marelly's and a graduate of Missouri State University (then known as SMS). "Instead of putting Crosslines in a situation of &nbsp;'what if,' now they can say, 'We did everything we could.'"</P>
<P>"Crosslines contacted us when they had the need for an AED but couldn't afford one," said Beth Perkins, coordinator of OTC's AED Solutions program. "When Chip brought up the idea of donating one, we thought we'd go ahead and give it to Crosslines."</P>
<P>OTC's AED Solutions program is a component of the OTC Allied Health department and assists businesses, organizations and citizens who want to develop or implement an AED program.</P>
<P>Perkins said a lot of groups and organizations need an AED but may not realize it, including churches, parks and recreation groups, fitness centers, dental offices and health spas.</P>
<P>The new AED devices are very simple to operate and take very little time to explain how to use them. The CPR training takes more time and is taught hand-in-hand with the AED training.</P>
<P>"Anyone can use the AED, but a lot of people think the fire department is super close when there's an incident," Perkins said. "In the 5-7 minutes it takes for the fire department to get there, using the AED could already have saved a life."</P>
<P>In addition to giving the training, OT'C's AED Solutions also keeps a registry of all AEDs in Springfield. There is no fee for registering and the list allows Perkins to contact the owners of the devices when there is a recall or other issue with their AED.</P>
<P>Perkins can be contact at 417-447-8952 or <A href="mailto:perkinsb@otc.edu"><U>perkinsb@otc.edu</U></A>.</P>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>When fall classes begin at Ozarks Technical Community College, 32 high school students will take part on a new first-of-its-kind program designed to bring the best out of them.</p>
<p>Middle College, created to help with Springfield R-12 school district&rsquo;s high-school dropout rate, targets underachieving students who have the potential to excel, will give the students an opportunity to prepare themselves for a post-graduation life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The program is designed for students who are behind in school or have life circumstances whereby the traditional high school is not as suitable.&nbsp; These are bright kids and through assessment have demonstrated a high potential to do college level work.&nbsp; We will provide them with a lot of resources on campus to give them a leg up, but we will also insist they step up their own expectations for learning,&rdquo; said Dr. LaRaine Bauer, Middle College coordinator at OTC.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes, simply by taking them and dropping them into an adult-oriented college environment, students begin to take school more seriously and learning becomes relevant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The program is being conducted in partnership with the Springfield school district. It&rsquo;s funded in part with grants from the Community Foundation of the Ozarks, the Missouri Department of Economic Development, and the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.</p>
<p>While the Middle College is designed to assist students that are struggling in high school, this program is also designed to address the needs of students that are historically underserved or lack access to higher education .</p>
<p>The students, who had to apply and were selected through a series of assessments and interviews, will make OTC their home and participate one of two career pathways, either Early Childhood Development or Diesel/Automotive Technology. They will take classes to complete their high-school education along with earning free college credit. They will also work an internship at a selected business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The internship component makes us unique. After they earn their diploma, they can enter the workforce with some valuable skills or continue in higher education and stay with us or go on to get their four-year degree,&rdquo; Bauer said.</p>
<p>OTC officials said the program is the first of its kind in Missouri.</p>
<p>Although there will be 32 in the first class, the 2009 class is expected to expand to 96 Springfield students. Two more areas of study being considered are medical services and manufacturing. Eventually, the program may be expanded to outlying school districts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wanted to find a way to engage the disengaged student. Higher education is built around the college bound but we&rsquo;ve forgotten about the non-college bound. There is a need for post-high school training that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean getting a college degree,&rdquo; said OTC President Dr. Hal Higdon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being on campus all day gets them a job. It helps them earn some money. Going to work in a field of study is key and it gets them college credit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Norm Ridder, superintendent of Springfield school, said the program will serve a number of needs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A focus of student engagement early in their careers in diesel mechanics and child care serves both the child and the industry needs within the Springfield community. This is a direct connection between the classroom and the world of work, and for many of our children this connection is necessary for them to understand the importance of education in their careers,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>For more information on the program, contact Dr. Bauer at (417) 447-6908 or by email bauerl@otc.edu</p>

                    <P>Distance learning means just that &nbsp;learning at a distance.</P>
<P>So, this years celebration of National Distance Learning Week Nov. 10-14, will be offered with a twist. The entire showcase will be available online for the first time for anyone to see anywhere in world.</P>
<P>OTC will host the 2014 Innovation Showcase in collaboration with Missouri Distance Learning Association, Springfield Public Schools, Evangel University, Missouri State University and Drury University. </P>
<P>"Because Innovation Showcase celebrates National Distance Learning Week, it was important to make the Showcase accessible to everyone no matter where they are," said Phillip Arnold, director of eLearning Systems at OTC.</P>
<P>"This years Innovation Showcase will allow remote faculty and students to participate in this event virtually from wherever they may have Internet access."</P>
<P>The&nbsp;purpose of this week-long event is to recognize innovative teaching and learning practices and bring awareness to the many different modes through which students now learn: online, face-to-face and in a hybrid setting that is a combination of online and seated class.</P>
<P>"We have enjoyed partnering with area institutions to create this years Innovation Showcase," said Matt Harris, college director of OTC Online.</P>
<P>"The program emphasizes effective instructional practices and technologies specific to distance education but can be applied to any learning environment."</P>
<P>Dr. Jeff Borden, director of Pearsons Center for eLearning, will provide the showcases keynote address on Thursday, Nov. 6 from 1-3 p.m. in Lincoln Hall on the OTC Springfield Campus. </P>
<P>Borden, a consultant, speaker, professor, comedian and trainer, has presented internationally about teaching practices driven by creativity and technology. </P>

		<title>OTC hosts emergency technicians for simulation training</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
                    
                    <p>Ozarks Technical Community College was the site for emergency medical technicians and paramedics from Cox Hospitals to take part in simulated emergency training Thursday.</p>
<p>The technicians faced four emergency scenarios ranging from a five-year-old child with an ear infection reacting to medication to a 59-year-old man with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Teams of technicians were required to recognize the problem and treat it as evaluators watched them work.</p>
<p>The training is held monthly and about 180 Cox technicians take part in the training scenarios each quarter in order to qualify for recertification.</p>
<p>The scenarios made use of the College&rsquo;s interactive high-fidelity manikins that can breathe, bleed, sweat, and speak and are designed to simulate patients of various ages with various emergency situations that included a cardiac arrest scenario and an asthma patient who stopped breathing.</p>
<p>Thursday&rsquo;s simulations involved dealing with respiratory issues. A previous simulation session held in the spring dealt with cardiac issues and the next session will deal with trauma issues.</p>
<p>More than 40 Cox emergency medical personnel participated in Thursday&rsquo;s training and Dr. Matt Brandt, medical director of OTC&rsquo;s EMT program, said observers evaluate the technicians in three areas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are judged on critical decision-making skills, scene management and skills performance, such as delivering an IV and intubating a patient,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The simulation manikins are a critical part of the training&rsquo;s effectiveness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simulation training can be used to see areas in which students perform well, as well as areas of weakness, which helps us to be proactive in educating students before they graduate, take their licensure exams, and go to work in the community,&rdquo; said Michelle Howard, Allied Health simulation director for the College.</p>
<p>OTC is planning to expand the current simulation facilities into a complete Simulation Center, which will help train 11 different disciplines in the College&rsquo;s Allied Health division as well as healthcare professionals in the community.</p>
<p>When the Simulation Center is complete, the College will continue to host regular simulation events for Cox Hospitals and will provide opportunities for open lab training.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brandt said the simulation training is available for any area of emergency personnel and is not restricted to Cox technicians. Those interested in taking the training can contact David Allen at 417-818-0390.</p>

                    <P>At-risk youth may not see attending college as an option.</P>

<P>But a groundbreaking program initiated at OTC and several of the area's four-year colleges gives the students a chance to improve their educational lives by giving them and their case workers specific names, faces and contact information of advisors at the colleges who can assist them in enrolling and gaining financial aid.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Recently, the college joined with Missouri State, Drury and Evangel universities to form the Crossover Youth Educational Partnerships committee and held a training session at OTC where representatives from the colleges met with local social service agencies to help teach them how they can reach out to students in need of educational guidance.</P>
<P></P>
<P>"The purpose of the training was to teach case workers how to navigate admissions and financial aid alongside their students at the four colleges represented," said Jason Morgan, vocational resource educator of high school programs at OTC.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The national Crossover Youth Initiative is being led by educators at Georgetown University who saw what OTC and others were doing in reaching out to case workers and invited Morgan to lead a webinar for those in 28 other states who are developing the same program. More than 70 people watched Morgans presentation.</P>
<P></P>
<P>"Essentially, I was walking the other sites through the process of setting up a similar partnership in their communities, a network of support that puts students and case workers in touch with helpful information and resources on each campus," he said.</P>
<P></P>
<P>"It gives a face, name and contact information to those who may be apprehensive about walking into a large institution and navigating all the processes alone. "</P>
<P></P>
<P>Macon Stewart, program manager for the Center for Juvenile Justice Reform at Georgetown, wrote in an email that&nbsp;Greene County representatives were "thinking outside the box " with their approach.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The colleges "took on the development of several innovations to improve outcomes and opportunities for youth involved in their systems. The work of the subcommittee is unique in that no other site to date has explored exposing youth to collegiate opportunities in this manner," she wrote.</P>
<P></P>

<P>Johnson, who teaches audio engineering in the Electronic Media Production department at OTC, plays bass fiddle in the group that has been making the rounds in the Ozarks playing at various nightspots and private parties.</P>
<P>Johnson plays other instruments, including guitar and saxophone, and as a result, he can bring those talents to the classroom and his students where they learn the latest in audio recording technology.</P>
<P>"Being able to play a lot of instruments means I can track the instruments myself without bringing in a musician for each instrument. Students can see the new way things are done at concerts and other venues through my experience," said Johnson, who has been teaching full-time at OTC for four years.</P>
<P>Having the summer off from teaching, Johnson and the group have been able to play a lot. Lately, the group has been playing events to raise money at <A href="http://www.kickstarter.com/"><U>www.kickstarter.com</U></A> to pay for production of its first hard-copy EP. The money will cover the cost of producing and printing the album that will feature all original music. </P>
<P>Johnson, 36, is a Hillcrest High School graduate who played saxophone and drums in in the school's marching band and jazz band.</P>
<P>It was a friend, who played banjo, who talked Johnson into playing bass with him and his music career resumed. </P>
<P>Johnson also has a background in videography and video production having worked for local television stations and the Springfield Cardinals.</P>
<P>But music is his passion and he wants to continue playing and teaching.</P>
<P>"Id like to pursue it as much as I can. I love what I do at OTC and what I do musically helps me in the classroom," he said. "I think things just as they are. I dont want to have to choose between OTC and music."</P>
<P></P>

                    <p>One trip is all it took for Becky Crocker to know that Haiti would always be a part of her life.</p>
<p>Crocker, an instructor in Ozarks Technical Community College&rsquo;s Physical Therapist Assistant program, recently returned from a week in the earthquake-ravaged country where she participated in Project Medishare, a program established by the University of Miami Schools of Medicine and Nursing to offer medical care to the Haitian people.</p>
<p>Crocker learned of the program through a friend, and within three hours of contacting the organization, she had a plane ticket to Port-au-Prince.</p>
<p>Medical personnel have been going to Haiti to help the injured trying to recover from the earthquake that devastated the country in January.</p>
<p>Crocker took care of patients suffering from a variety of wounds, from providing therapy to those with spinal cord injuries to helping others suffering from severe pressure ulcers from being bed-ridden.</p>
<p>The conditions in Haiti are not improving, Crocker said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are rats as big as cats. Kids are walking around with rat bites. There are people with wounds from guns because of the violence. There is a lot of spousal abuse. There&rsquo;s going to be a lot of typhoid with the waste water running everywhere,&rdquo; Crocker said.</p>
<p>There is little permanent housing, Crocker said. Instead, a half-million 8-by-10 tents sit side by side for residents to use. With the hurricane season approaching, the results could be devastating, Crocker said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The city is not rebuilding. There&rsquo;s no place to rebuild because there&rsquo;s so much rubble. It&rsquo;s being taken away a wheelbarrow at a time," she said. &ldquo;I think to myself that these people are never going to recover, but then the streets are lined with vendors selling everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite the devastation, the spirit of the Haitian people amazes Crocker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How they love, laugh and smile. How does that happen? I thought I had a good handle on life. They have something more. They can get through situations we can&rsquo;t imagine. I don&rsquo;t understand how they do it,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all so amazing, Crocker said. She plans to return to the country to help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going back because I can. There&rsquo;s more to do,&rdquo; she said.</p>

                    <P>A collaboration by two OTC instructors, one in music and the other in art, has resulted in a unique music instruction book for those looking to learn to play the Native American flute.</P>
<P>The Mel Bay-published book, "First Lessons Native American Flute:&nbsp;How to Sit on a Rock" was developed and written by music instructor Andrew Bishko, who brought in art instructor Tom McCune to do all of the book's illustrations.</P>
<P>Bishko, who has been playing the Native American flute since 2004, said the book is not so much an instruction book but a guide that urges experimentation and creativity in learning how to play. That's why the title includes the suggestion to learn how to sit on a rock.</P>
<P>"If you want to learn how to play, go sit on a rock and play. Let the flute teach you by imitating the sounds of the wind and birds," he said.</P>
<P>Bishko, a classically trained musician who plays the traditional flute, piano and saxophone, said he loves world music and was introduced to the Native American flute many years ago while playing with a reggae band when a man handed him one of the wooden flutes. </P>
<P>"I vowed to get one some day and 15 years later I got one in Alaska," Bishko said. "I only played it outside for two years trying to imitate bird songs. I got the idea to turn what I was doing into a book because no one was doing it as I was."</P>
<P>After putting a draft of the book together, Bishko contacted McCune, an accomplished artist in ink drawings and watercolor painting, who was teaching at OTC.</P>
<P>"I loved his watercolors. His graphics are so clean. They flow right into my text," Bishko said.</P>
<P>McCune, who has been painting for 45 years, said Bishko showed him the rough draft and liked the theme.</P>
<P>"He had a great storyline, the seasons and the sounds of nature. He had original ideas of what he wanted to show. I put his verbal ideas into illustrations," McCune said.</P>
<P>McCune admits he was a little nervous having never illustrated a music instruction book.</P>
<P>"I dont know anything about music. I can't play anything but the radio," he said.</P>

                    <p>An original Civil War short play, written by an Ozarks Technical Community College instructor, will debut tonight as part of First Friday Artwalk.</p>
<p>The work, entitled &ldquo;Beloved Exile,&rdquo; was written by Jon Herbert, theater arts instructor at OTC, and is based on the memoir of Louisa Cheairs McKenney Sheppard, one the founders of Springfield.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students will present the staged reading at 7:30 and 8:30 tonight on the third floor of the Gillioz Theater where the OTC Fine Arts Department is located.</p>
<p>The reading is part of this month&rsquo;s faculty showcase for First Friday Artwalk. Other faculty presentations will include art displays by six instructors and a live musical performance by two other instructors.</p>
<p>In Herbert&rsquo;s play, a Confederate woman, Lucy, has sons fighting in Arkansas not long after the Battle <ins datetime="2010-09-30T08:55" cite="mailto:OTC">of </ins>Springfield. The Union has control of Springfield. Her sons and their compatriots are sick, and she wants to go to them, but cannot get passage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She eventually <ins datetime="2010-09-30T08:39" cite="mailto:Jon%20Herbert">convinces </ins>a Union officer and long-time friend, C.B. Holland into writing her papers of exile. The memoir says that she saw this as an act of kindness, but that he was much chagrinned by it,&rdquo; Herbert said.</p>
<p>Herbert wrote the play in conjunction with his <ins datetime="2010-09-30T08:40" cite="mailto:Jon%20Herbert">playwriting </ins>class, in which students were assigned to write plays about the Civil War based on research culled from<ins datetime="2010-09-30T08:41" cite="mailto:Jon%20Herbert"> </ins><ins datetime="2010-09-30T08:57" cite="mailto:OTC">a </ins><ins datetime="2010-09-30T08:56" cite="mailto:OTC">local Ozarks Civil War Web site.</ins></p>
<p>&ldquo;Since finishing the play, Herbert has been asked to perform it tonight and also at a <ins datetime="2010-09-30T08:44" cite="mailto:Jon%20Herbert">fundraiser </ins>next <ins datetime="2010-09-30T08:44" cite="mailto:Jon%20Herbert">week </ins>for the Wilson Creek Foundation. It may be performed again next year at the Battle of Wilson Creek&rsquo;s 150<sup>th</sup> anniversary celebration</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know there was going to have all this demand for it,&rdquo; Herbert said.</p>
<p>Sheppard&rsquo;s memoir, "A Confederate Girlhood," can be read on the Springfield-Greene County Library's digital collection: "Community and Conflict: the Impact of the Civil War on the Ozarks" at <ins datetime="2010-09-30T08:46" cite="mailto:Jon%20Herbert">www.ozarkscivilwar.org</ins>.</p>

                    <SPAN lang=EN>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Recently, national universities, including Ivy League institutions, have received unwanted headlines for their handling of sexual assault cases. Those high-profile cases have shone a light on the issue.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Ozarks Technical Community College has been a leader in offering its staff and personnel from other institutions in-depth training in investigating Title IX reports.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>In June, more than 100 representatives from across the country came to Springfield for a two-day conference sponsored by OTC and Drury University. The two higher education institutions first came together in the spring of 2013 for a collaborative Title IX training.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"The training was in response to what the federal Department of Education is expecting in terms of investigating student sexual assault and harassment reports," said Julia Edwards, assistant dean, disability support services and Title IX coordinator for students. "That's what we all worked on. We are trying to be more proactive here. Were very interested in making things safe for students.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>A total of 14 OTC team members participated in the training along with attendees from nine states that included some from as far away as Ohio and Tennessee.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>There are plans for OTC and Drury to host another Title IX training in June 2015.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"Our presenter, Saunie Schuster, from the National Center on Higher Education Risk Management, was highly complementary of our collaboration with Drury staff," Edwards said. "She was also surprised that the conference drew participants from so many different states. The next session in 2015 illustrates further collaboration we have with the National Center on Higher Education Risk Management."</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Edwards, who has been handling Title IX cases for OTC for a number of years, said training is on-going throughout the year to properly investigate reports she and others on the Title IX investigation team handle, which average about 10-12 a year.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"The explosion of social media use as a harassment tool has added to more incidents of bullying on the Internet and intimidating texts being sent," she said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Edwards said training is planned for students about responsibility, informed consent and their rights in the process of civil rights investigations.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>In deciding what action to take in student cases, it is the preponderance of the evidence standard and not the criminal-based beyond a reasonable doubt standard that determines if disciplinary action is taken against a student.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"The federal government, as well as OTC, insists on students being safe," Edwards said. "Even off-campus incidents can have campus implications. We are responsible to look into them all."</P></SPAN>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>When a major tornado disaster tore through Joplin, Mo. on Sunday, May 22, Ozarks Technical Community College (OTC) College responded with the speed, flexibility and organization that is a community college&rsquo;s forte.</p>
<p>In less than 24 hours, OTC, in partnership with the Journal Broadcast Group, began collecting tons of needed goods and tens of thousands of dollars for Joplin&rsquo;s tornado victims, who live just 60 miles west of the College.</p>
<p>As of Monday, May 31, monetary donations surpassed $71,000 and last  Friday morning, the eighth and ninth trucks left OTC for Joplin.</p>
<p>The southeast corner of OTC&rsquo;s Springfield, Mo., campus came alive as thousands of good-hearted people in the Springfield Metropolitan area streamed on campus for four days, bringing with them everything imaginable for the relief effort.</p>
<p>It was an overwhelming sight for College officials and volunteers to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OTC was happy and proud to serve as a conduit between those who wanted to give and those in need in Joplin. The work of the volunteers and the generosity of those who gave speak volumes about the people in this community. Whenever there is a need they are ready to lend a helping hand,&rdquo; said Dr. Hal L. Higdon, president of Ozarks Technical Community College.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We also want to thank Prime Inc. and Jim Towery at Steelman Transportation for the use of several semi-trailers to transport the items to Joplin. And the effort of the radio stations of the Journal Broadcast Group played a big part in bringing people to campus. Without their contribution, the effort would not have been as successful as it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kim Greene, a volunteer from the OTC Online office, said the turnout amazed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should be proud of what this amazing community is doing. They make this the best place to live,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The stories of those who have contributed or volunteered are touching and amazing.</p>
<p>Monday night, an unemployed man delivered a case of water, and said it was all he could afford. A woman contributed $1 she received after she returned a loaf of bread to her grocery store to get a refund.</p>
<p>Two small children riding with their parents to the drop-off site wanted to donate the car seats they were riding in.</p>
<p>The Girl Scouts showed up Tuesday night with 9,312 boxes of Girl Scout cookies.</p>
<p>People dropped off checks of $1,000, $2,000 and $2,500. A member of a local church brought a check for $5,000 Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>A mother with two children stopped by, one child held a dollar, the other, two dollars. And an elementary school brought over $1,100 in dollars and coins. One child came with $31 in change contained in four plastic sandwich bags and an Easter egg.</p>
<p>Volunteers thought their work was over one night when man with an enormous collection of goods from Jefferson County, Missouri, near St. Louis, rolled onto campus at 9 p.m. They unloaded a long horse trailer filled with water and other needed items before returning home.</p>
<p>The College updated their Facebook and Twitter accounts constantly to apprise the community of special needs and times of collection. A local group of radio stations broadcast live from the scene for four days urging contributions. Several local companies donated thousands of empty boxes for packing.</p>
<p>The College received calls from across the country.</p>
<p>Someone from northern Minnesota called to say a car seat and baby bassinette was on the way. Another person in Arizona had new women&rsquo;s clothes to send. The Marine Corp League from Tuscaloosa, Ala., was coming with water. An Atlanta-based company was sending flashlights and batteries. A delivery truck was coming from Kansas City filled with items.</p>
<p>People came with their own stories of victims they knew in Joplin. They had once lived there themselves or knew people who had lost loved ones, homes or all their belongings.</p>
<p>Within a day of starting the relief effort two tractor-trailers, each hauling about 35,000 pounds of goods, left for Joplin. College officials found College Heights Christian Church near Joplin that was accepting large donations.</p>
<p>But in the short time it took to get to Joplin, the church was overflowing and couldn&rsquo;t accept any more donations.</p>
<p>The grounds of the church were covered with all types of items when the first OTC semi rolled in.</p>
<p>Long, deep rows of water were stacked on the church&rsquo;s sidewalk. Mound after mound of clothing was heaped against the church wall, covered with blue tarps in anticipation of yet another storm that was expected to slam Joplin that night.</p>
<p>The College trucks were directed to Crossroads Warehouse, owned by a church member.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fantastic to see what everyone is doing. They&rsquo;re doing whatever it takes,&rdquo; said one&nbsp; church volunteer.</p>
<p>Volunteers, members of the OTC Bookstore, and warehouse workers unloaded the first OTC semi in 80 minutes. All the goods were stacked in the cavernous warehouse among row after row of other items &mdash; everything from baby food, pet food, charcoal, energy drinks and paper goods were there in long, tall rows.</p>
<p>Since that first load, eight more OTC trucks have delivered goods to Joplin.</p>
<p>While the College truck didn&rsquo;t drive into the devastated area, there was plenty of evidence along Interstate 44 that the tornado was massive and destructive.</p>
<p>Mile after mile, trees looked like a giant foot had stepped them on. Other trees that escaped destruction were strewn with bits of paper, insulation and home siding. Boards stuck in the ground like javelins. Metal was twisted around highway signs like tin foil.</p>
<p>Another volunteer who lived in Joplin couldn&rsquo;t make out landmarks in town after the tornado hit. He described it as something out of a science fiction movie.</p>
<p>But one of the most compelling stories comes from Tanya Willhite, 22, who graduated from Missouri State University just over a week ago.</p>
<p>Tanya knows Joplin very well. She grew up in Carl Junction, Mo., just a few miles east of Joplin. Many of her friends and classmates lived in Joplin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all go to Joplin. We shop there. We do everything there,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>She went shopping in Joplin with her parents the day before the tornado hit and was at her parents&rsquo; home in Carl Junction Sunday when the destruction took place.</p>
<p>She spent Sunday and part of Monday trying to contact her Joplin family and friends.</p>
<p>Tanya, who lived in Springfield while attending Missouri State, was back in Springfield Monday when she heard about the relief effort at OTC.</p>
<p>She came to OTC Tuesday and Wednesday to volunteer in the relief effort. She couldn&rsquo;t help Thursday &mdash; she was getting her gall bladder removed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be there but I&rsquo;ll be unconscious. I&rsquo;m so glad this is here for the people of Joplin. This was so great. I can&rsquo;t thank everyone enough for what they did. As soon as I get out of the hospital, I&rsquo;m going to Joplin to help there,&rdquo; she said.</p>

		<title>OTC marking 10th anniversary of tobacco-free initiative</title>

                    <P>In 1999, only one university in the country was tobacco-free. That same year, OTC decided it would join the California institution and begin taking steps to banish tobacco products from all of its campuses and centers.</P>
<P>In August 2003, OTC officially became tobacco-free and on Wednesday, it will mark the milestone with a celebration at 2 p.m. at the Springfield Campus.</P>
<P>"We are proud to mark the 10th anniversary of OTC taking a leadership role in removing tobacco from all of our campuses and centers," said OTC Chancellor Dr. Hal L. Higdon.</P>
<P>Thanks to the guidance of then-OTC president Dr. Norman Myers and Ty Paterson, now-retired Vice President of Student Affairs, the changeover to become tobacco-free was relatively uneventful as the college gradually made the changes.</P>
<P>Myers at the time asked the Board of Trustees to go tobacco-free in order for the College to be consistent with the health message that was being taught in the Colleges classrooms, to help protect visiting highs students from tobacco exposure and to prevent the mounting cigarette butt litter on an otherwise clean campus.</P>
<P>"An unanticipated effect of the tobacco-free campus effort has been that, in contrast to non tobacco-free colleges whose tobacco-using percentage of students increased during their college years, the percentage of tobacco users at OTC actually decreased," said Dr. Jim Blaine, who oversees the OTC Health and Wellness Center.</P>
<P>OTC created the Center of Excellence for Tobacco-Free Campus Policy in 2004 to share best practices with other organizations. </P>
<P>In 2010, the center was reorganized as the National Center for Tobacco Policy, a nonprofit organization that helps organizations develop, implement and sustain tobacco-free or smoke-free open space policies. </P>
<P>The center also is supported by Drury University. Paterson is the executive director.</P>
<P>"Since the creation of the National Center for Tobacco Policy here, it has helped lead hundreds of other colleges and institutions through the necessary steps in making their facilities tobacco-free," Higdon said.</P>
<P>"The tobacco-free policy has been a worthwhile and rewarding 10-year effort."</P>
<P>Blaine said OTC has become a national model that other universities and institutions look to for guidance on becoming tobacco-free.</P>
<P></P>
<P>"I am very proud of OTC and the leadership role they have assumed in the tobacco-free campus effort over the past 10 years and currently," Blaine said.</P>

                    <p>Ozarks Technical Community College is launching an ambitious group of multi-million dollar construction projects to keep pace with the needs of our students.</p>
<p>From new construction to extensive remodeling, the plan will roll out over a two-year period. The OTC Board of Trustees recently approved $10 million in financing for a number of projects at Springfield, Lebanon and Hollister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will be investing considerable resources into our communities in order to expand our offerings and more effectively serve the citizens in those areas,&rdquo; said Dr. Hal Higdon, president of the College.&nbsp; &ldquo;While we have a significant need for expansions throughout the College, these projects are a great beginning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the Springfield campus, approximately $2 million will be spent to add 10 classrooms and three faculty offices to the west end of Information Commons West. The work is expected to be completed for the fall 2011 semester.</p>
<p>The rooms, each about 1,000 square feet in size and equipped with state-of-the-art media equipment and technical tools, will provide learning space for 2,400 students a day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This project demonstrates the need for space, on the Springfield campus, and we are committed to use any space that is available,&rdquo; said Rob Rector, vice president of administrative services.</p>
<p>The new classroom addition will create an opportunity to move the fitness center from the second floor to the first floor of ICW, putting it closer to the locker room facilities on that floor.</p>
<p>The caf&eacute; area will undergo extensive remodeling to be finished for this fall semester. The d&eacute;cor and menu will change. Students will be offered a variety of new branded foods, including chicken and pizza that will continue to be prepared by student workers.</p>
<p>In Lebanon, about $3 million will be spent to build 19 classrooms, parking lots and technical education facilities at the new center. Reuben and Mary Lou Casey of San Clemente, Calif., donated the $2.6 million facility to the college last year. The improvements are expected to be ready by the fall of 2011.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In Hollister, the college is searching for land to locate the newest OTC education facility and plans to will spend approximately $5 million to complete the development of the center.</p>

		<title>OTC music student thrives without piano</title>

                    <p>When Luke Lyons hears a melody in his head, he sometimes has to reach for the closest paper bag.</p>
<p>Lyons, a student at Ozarks Technical Community College from Springfield, wants to be a composer but for now supports himself working at a at a McDonald&rsquo;s restaurant in Springfield.</p>
<p>When inspiration hits him at work, he reaches for whatever is handy at the restaurant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I write melodies on napkins and Happy Meal bags,&rdquo; Lyons said.</p>
<p>When he gets home, his melodic notes are transferred onto his music binder where Lyons keeps his work. He&rsquo;s completed several original compositions and has more in the works.</p>
<p>What makes Lyons&rsquo; work even most stunning is that he doesn&rsquo;t own a piano. Instead, he uses the piano laboratory at OTC&rsquo;s Fine Arts Department to work out his compositions. Lyons studied music theory and other piano courses at OTC.</p>
<p>Lyons, 20, has performed some of his works in public to great acclaim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luke has such a gift of composition.&nbsp;&nbsp;He has worked hour after hour in the piano lab.&nbsp;&nbsp;His desire is so strong that he will drive anywhere to get to a piano to compose.&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been a long time since I have seen a student whose passion drives them to succeed and be better,&rdquo; said Jennifer McAtee, instructor of music at OTC.</p>
<p>Lyons, who was home schooled, took about 18 months of formal piano lessons when he was a child but lost interest in playing at age 15.</p>
<p>A few years ago, he started teaching himself again and then took up an interest in composing for movies.</p>
<p>Without owning a piano, Lyons practices at OTC and at piano labs at other area colleges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not having a piano might hamper my learning at bit since I can&rsquo;t afford the gas to drive everywhere there&rsquo;s a piano available,&rdquo; Lyons said.</p>
<p>The second-year student does use a keyboard app on his iPhone to write music. The first movement of a recent piece Lyons wrote was composed on his phone.</p>
<p>Despite the hurdles, Lyons is confident he will succeed because of what he feels when he plays the piano.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything is gone when I&rsquo;m at the piano. Everything goes away. It&rsquo;s total contentment. I could sit at the piano the rest of my life,&rdquo; Lyons said.</p>

		<title>OTC offering classes for night owls</title>

                    <p>Welcome to late night at Ozarks Technical Community College.</p>
<p>For the first time, the college will be offering classes that begin at 10 p.m. and 11:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Reita Gorman, dean of general education, said the idea was prompted when she noticed the students living in her same apartment complex were &ldquo;just getting started when I was going to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought we might need to offer late night classes for students who don&rsquo;t get started until 10. When I asked students in my class about the idea, they were all over it,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>English composition, Algebra and Theatre classes will be offered this spring at either 10 p.m. or 11:30 p.m. in the Norman K. Myers Technical Education Center, with classes in other subjects expected to be added for spring.</p>
<p>Gorman said the late-night schedule takes advantage of classrooms that are filled to capacity during the day but sit empty late at night. The classes also accommodate those students who work a late shift.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to throw it out there and see how it works,&rdquo; Gorman said, adding that eventually she expects every department to begin offering late-night classes.</p>
<p>Jessica Hyatt will be teaching the 11:30 class. It&rsquo;s her first late-night class although she&rsquo;s taught early-morning classes that began at 6:30.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm a night owl so I was eager to volunteer to teach. The students in the 6:30 class who were genuinely morning people really liked having class that early and were quite successful,&rdquo; Hyatt said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would say that students signing up for a class at an unusual time should really think about it &mdash;&nbsp;not just about whether they can be there at that time of day, but whether they really want to be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To register for these classes offerings or others, visit www.otc.edu.</p>

                    <p>As classes filled up for the fall semester at Ozarks Technical Community College, administrators began looking for a way to provide for those students who were unable to enroll in the classes they needed. &nbsp;The solution: &nbsp;for the first time in the College&rsquo;s history, OTC will offer Late Start Courses, or classes that begin after the semester is already underway.<br /> <br /> &ldquo;The need for additional courses became more clear as we realized we were not going to meet the demand with our existing schedule,&rdquo; said Dr. Hal Higdon, president of Ozarks Technical Community College. &nbsp;&ldquo;This innovative program will make it possible for more students to take the classes they need to keep their education on track.&rdquo;<br /> <br /> These classes will meet on Fridays and/or Saturdays beginning Friday, September 18, and will meet through the end of the semester. &nbsp;Class periods will be extended to offset the late start. &nbsp;The ten course offerings are primarily introductory and prerequisite classes, including Business, Allied Health, psychology, English composition and developmental math courses.<br /> <br /> &ldquo;On the last day of registration, we turned away a significant number of students who were too late to get the foundation classes they needed. &nbsp;We created the Late Start Courses as an opportunity to help those students progress in their education,&rdquo; explained Dr. Randy Humphrey, Vice President for Academic Affairs. &nbsp;&ldquo;This program is one more way that OTC is working to provide exactly what our students need, when they need it.&rdquo;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> For information about Late Start course offerings, registration dates and procedures, call 417-447-6900 or visit the weblink: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.otc.edu">http://www.otc.edu</a><br /> </span><br /></p>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>Ozarks Technical Community College finds itself at the forefront in the challenge to help in tough economic times.</p>
<p>And residents are finding OTC as a place to go to further their education and training in order to gain a foothold on a new and better job.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s spring enrollment was up more than 7 percent over last spring and fall enrollment is expected to increase as well.</p>
<p>Both credit and non-credit programs, along with those in the technical fields, are growing and gaining popularity with incoming students, especially displaced workers looking to gain more education and training before reentering the workforce.</p>
<p>In the months ahead, the College will be increasing its outreach to the region to help keep its economic engine working properly with both long-term and short-term efforts.</p>
<p>The addition of Dawn Busick as OTC&rsquo;s new executive director of the Center for Workforce Development is key to the College&rsquo;s commitment to bring expertise and experience to the position.</p>
<p>As the center&rsquo;s new leader, Busick will be responsible for developing, supervising and maintaining high quality post-secondary workforce development programs.&nbsp; She will also provide leadership for a district-wide organizational structure that will deliver workforce development, training and consulting services, business development and professional development opportunities for business and industry constituents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I view Dawn&rsquo;s hiring as a coming together of the right time, the right place and the right person. Dawn&rsquo;s expertise in Workforce Development and her strong knowledge of state and federal training resources will help position our Center for Workforce Development to greatly increase its service to Southwest Missouri,&rdquo; said OTC President Hal Higdon.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> &ldquo;In the first few months of her tenure, I will be encouraging her to get out into the business community and get to know all of the leaders in an effort to build strong partnerships to make southwest Missouri and even stronger economic engine for our state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Staffed by experienced trainers and consultants, the Center for Workforce Development specializes in building leadership, developing business and training the local workforce.</p>
<p>The Center provides a variety of training options, including courses in lean manufacturing, management development, and quality and process improvement, as well as computer and technical workshops. &nbsp;In addition, the Center, in partnership with Metropolitan Community College, is an authorized OSHA Training Institute provider and also operates the Transport Training Institute.</p>
<p>OTC last month addressed a critical issue in helping displaced workers by opening a liaison office in the Missouri Career Center in Springfield.</p>
<p>Bruce Clemens staffs the office at the center to discuss training and education options, working with directors and staff at the center to try to identify the best short-term and degree programs that need to be put into place to offer viable employment.</p>
<p>Clemens said the majority of people he has met with have enrolled in non-credit health care training since those jobs have the most viable employers in the area.</p>
<p>Others are going into credit-degree programs in Industrial Control and Automation and Health Information Technology. He said there is still great interest in the Transport Training Institute and in the Apprentice Lineman training.</p>
<p>Dana Patterson, director of OTC&rsquo;s Continuing Education Center, said referrals from Clemens&rsquo; office have increased for a number of programs that only require a few weeks&rsquo; training in order to be certified.</p>
<p>Those programs, ranging from eight to 11 weeks long include: pharmacy technician, phlebotomy technician, certified nurse assistant, medical claims analyst and certified medication technician.</p>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>Ozarks Technical Community College will be offering a number of new short-term technical training programs this summer designed for those people looking for entry-level employment.</p>
<p>The first program will cover basic automotive work in areas ranging from brakes to air conditioning. The classes were chosen by school officials in order to equip students with the training to go to work in the shortest timeframe possible.</p>
<p>Students completing the program will benefit from placement assistance through OTC's Career Employment Services office and from Transportation Division personnel. There is no guarantee of employment is made or implied.</p>
<p>Shirley Lawler, Associate Vice President of Academic Affairs, said OTC officials talked with employers and the Missouri Career Center, which serves the local unemployed, about what technical programs are needed in the immediate future.</p>
<p>The automotive courses will run from June 1 through July 23. The courses can be applied later toward an applied science degree. For more information, call 447-8133.</p>
<p>OTC will also offer summer courses in auto body, diesel, computer information technology, early childhood, graphic design, hospitality, and welding.&nbsp; For more information these programs, call 841-3340.</p>
<p>Kerry Wrinkle, Transportation Division Chair, said when someone finishes the automotive training, the student should be able to work in any tire shop that does alignments as well as be able to install brakes and service air conditioning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The course will offer a good mix from working on cars as well as trucks,&rdquo; Wrinkle said. &ldquo;With the current economy, people are holding on to their older cars and need them services. Summer coming on people traveling want their car serviced A/C worked on.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>Bring it by, drag in it, haul it over.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve got something that needs welding, you can bring it to Ozarks Technical Community College Saturday, April 18, from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., in the Welding Lab, located on the north side of the Industry Transportation and Technology Center, near the corner of Central Street and National Avenue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the college&rsquo;s second-annual Community Welding Day, a day set aside to give something back to the community.</p>
<p>On Saturday, residents can have their broken lawn furniture, lawn mower decks, wheelbarrows, barbecue grills, tables, gates and trellises repaired. Items made of carbon steel, aluminum and stainless steel can be repaired.</p>
<p>Student volunteers from OTC&rsquo;s advanced welding class will make the repairs.</p>
<p>There will be no charge for the repairs but donations will be accepted for the Bikers for Babies fundraiser for the March of Dimes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;We end up receiving more that way than if we had a set charge,&rdquo; said Jim Bridwell, a welding instructor and advisor.</p>
<p>The idea for the outreach event came from a student in one of Bridwell&rsquo;s classes who wanted to have a fund-raiser for St. Jude&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital. Last year&rsquo;s event raised $400.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was something I wanted to do for a long time,&rdquo; Bridwell said. &ldquo;The students did top notch work for the people who showed up and the repairs they made. We didn&rsquo;t have to turn anyone away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turnout was fair last year but Bridwell is hoping more publicity with bring out more residents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re trying to get the word out. We want everyone to bring their broken stuff,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The event is sponsored by Lincoln Electric and it gives students a chance to gain more hands-on experience before they enter the workforce.&nbsp; Two student organizations, Skills USA and the student chapter of the American Welding Society, will be represented at the event. For more information, call 447-8119.</p>

		<title>OTC opens office at Missouri Career Center</title>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>Ozarks Technical Community College&rsquo;s new office at the Missouri Career Center has helped people like Troy Pruett and Pat Carr make the transition from being suddenly unemployed to a student who&rsquo;s learning new skills to find a new job.</p>
<p>The center reported seeing 8,700 clients in February. A number of those people have met with Bruce Clemens, OTC&rsquo;s workforce liaison who staffs the office at the center, to discuss training and education options.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are working closely with the directors and staff here to try to identify the best short-term training and degree programs to put in place to offer viable employment,&rdquo; Clemens said.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the hope of Pruett and Carr, who had never faced being unemployed until recently.</p>
<p>Pruett was laid off Feb. 10 without notice from a job he held for more than two years. After taking a few days to absorb the shock of being out of work for the first time in 18 years, he came to the career center.</p>
<p>Through the state&rsquo;s Dislocated Workers Program, Pruett was able to enroll in physical therapy assistant classes at OTC.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OTC and Bruce have helped so much. OTC was the only one offering classes I was interested in. When I meet with Bruce, I&rsquo;m getting the word straight from the horse&rsquo;s mouth. It&rsquo;s all in one spot where I can take care of everything. He tells me what&rsquo;s required for school; what I need,&rdquo; the 35-year-old Pruett said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m excited about going to school at OTC. I look at it as an opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For Carr, who is 60, she looks at her layoff as a chance to redefine herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have to make yourself over, take a new look. It&rsquo;s a complete change for me. I never thought I&rsquo;d be in this position,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Carr was working in the accounting office of a local firm when she was let go in January after working there for a year. Now, after meeting with Clemens and obtaining help through the dislocated worker plan, Carr is enrolling in pharmacy technician classes offered through OTC Continuing Education Center.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a blessing in disguise,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Clemens said clients like Pruett and Carr are more the rule than the exception when it comes to the types of people he sees everyday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They would be considered a non-traditional student for OTC. They are typically between the ages of 35 and 60 with a 10- to 20-year work history at one, or at most, a few employers. They badly need basic computer literacy skills, and are very apprehensive about returning to school. I have had everyone from laid-off construction workers to someone with an MBA who was let go from Wachovia when they were bought out recently by Wells Fargo,&rdquo; Clemens said.</p>
<p>Clemens said the majority of people he has met with have enrolled in non-credit health care training since those jobs have the most viable employers in the area.</p>
<p>Others, according to Clemens, are going into credit-degree programs in Industrial Control and Automation and Health Information Technology. He said there is still great interest in the Transport Training Institute and in the Apprentice Lineman training.</p>
<p>Dana Patterson, director of OTC&rsquo;s Continuing Education Center, said referrals from Clemens&rsquo; office have increased for the Pharmacy Technician, Phlebotomy Technician and Certified Nurse Assistant programs.</p>
<p>Patterson said the continuity that has developed between the center and OTC is to Clemens&rsquo; credit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;(Clemens) has provided a smooth conduit for students from the career center to the registration in our workforce training programs. This translates to referrals being more expedient and students getting better service from all of us providers,&rdquo; Patterson said.</p>
<p>Shirley Lawler, Associate Vice President of Academic Affairs, said she is pleased with the assistance OTC&rsquo;s office has been able to offer those looking for training and education to make them viable job seekers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bruce is the hub who finds out what people need. He comes to us and whomever needs to roll out a needed program goes ahead and works to roll it out, whether it&rsquo;s credit, non-credit or technical education,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Yet to be resolved is how federal stimulus money will be used toward OTC&rsquo;s efforts to assist the uunemployed seeking training and education.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not sure what we need to be rolling out. No one had an exact idea of what we need to do year. There are no specifics,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Clemens said about $3 million should be coming to the career center, money that will be divided among the various programs administered by the center.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bulk of this money will be allocated to training people for new employment. That's where OTC comes in. We are working closely with the directors and staff here to try to identify the best short-term training and degree programs to put in place to offer viable employment,&rdquo; he said.</p>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>Pulaski County students don&rsquo;t have much longer to wait to enjoy their own Ozarks Technical Community College education center.</p>
<p>The 10,300 square foot facility, featuring state-of-the-art classrooms, will be open in time for fall classes in August.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Located in the Town Field Plaza, 320 Ichord Ave., Suite U, in Waynesville, OTC&rsquo;s newest education center will offer a wide variety&nbsp;of courses that students can register for right now by calling (573) 774-5061. The email address is waynesville@otc.edu.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have found that the demand for classes in the Ft. Leonard Wood/St. Robert/Waynesville area falls primarily during the day, while we are currently only able to offer evening classes,&rdquo; said Hal Higdon, president of Ozarks Technical Community College.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;The move to a larger facility demonstrates our commitment to providing accessible, quality education to the region.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new education center will offer 35 day and evening classes to help students who want to enroll in college-credit courses this fall semester. These classes include: Biology, Business, Communication, English, Math and other general education courses.</p>
<p>Students can complete an Associate of Arts degree at the center, working toward fulfilling the requirements of a four-year degree.</p>
<p>Since Waynesville High School is an approved A+ campus, qualified students are eligible for tuition and fee reimbursements when they attend OTC at the new center.</p>
<p>They also receive 50 percent of their textbook costs through the program. The program applies to those taking classes at the center.</p>
<p>Information on the A+ program is available through the high school.</p>
<p>Sue Moore, OTC Dean of Extended Campus and College Outreach, said the center was established after a survey of Waynesville high school students expressed their desire in having an OTC center in their city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a lot of interest in students wanting to take classes (in Waynesville). Most of them wanted business, marketing and psychology classes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re there because we believe there&rsquo;s a need there. We&rsquo;re responding to the community and its needs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosalind Pride is OTC&rsquo;s new administrative assistant who will help oversee operations at Waynesville. She will also teach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the contact person. If they have questions or need some academic, advising, I am available to meet with them,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Bruce Harrill, Waynesville&rsquo;s city administrator, is excited to see OTC come to the city.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re happy to see OTC expanding to Waynesville. The center opens up an opportunity for our high school graduates to go on to higher education a quality community college and enhance their future employment opportunities for getting a job in the Waynesville area,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Harrill added that the opening of the center is just the beginning of a relationship with OTC.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see a lot of potential for a lot of different partnership opportunities.&rdquo;</p>

		<title>OTC Peace Table holds special meaning for chef</title>

                    <P>There is an emotional tug that Chef Paul Trout feels when he talks about the origins of the Holiday Peace Table event, held each year by the Culinary Arts Department at OTC.</P>
<P>"It came out of a class I was teaching at Delta College in Stockton (Calif.)," Trout said. He abruptly stopped talking and excused himself with tears in his eyes.</P>
<P>It was at Delta College that the Peace Table idea started because of some students with violent backgrounds. It was Trout's idea to get them to sit next to strangers they didn't like and share a meal in order to try to solve their differences.</P>
<P>"We were trying to bring people together over food, trying to bring some peace," Trout said.</P>
<P>The idea caught on at Delta and helped ease tensions. The chef liked it so much that he brought it to OTC when he came here six years ago.</P>
<P>The lunch buffet, held last week for about 150 diners, was produced by the contemporary cuisine and dining room management classes. </P>
<P>The students pick the menus from several different countries. This year it was Greek, Japanese and a bit of the Northeast U.S and included roasted lamb, grilled pork belly and sushi.</P>
<P>&nbsp;"The holiday peace table has been alive and well at OTC.&nbsp; It was designed to be a culmination of the culinary skills of the students in our programs," said Lisa Gardner, department chair of culinary and hospitality. </P>
<P></P>
<P>"Though it is an event for these two classes, other classes participate with displays of ice carvings, decorated cakes and chocolate sculptures." </P>
<P>?Trout said restaurants around the country are adopting the peace table approach of open seating idea with strangers sharing a table with other strangers. </P>
<P>"This is more than just sitting down and having a meal. The peace table has meaning," he said. </P>
<P>Students enjoyed participating in the event, too.</P>
<P>"I think it's a great idea," said Alyssa Bradley. "We bring people together. You sit with people you dont know and get to know them a bit."</P>
<P>Kim Holz, who worked serving in the buffet line, said her biggest worry was answering questions about the food.</P>
<P>"I just kept telling them to try it and theyll like it," she said.</P>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Ozarks Technical Community College is making preparations to insure that proper measures are in place to combat the oncoming onset of H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>College-aged students are one of the age groups likely to be hit hardest by the disease, experts said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are attempting to communicate vital information about the strain to the student body.&nbsp;We realize that a high percentage of students see themselves as bulletproof. We are going to stress the importance of the immunization,&rdquo; said Dr. Jim Blaine, who operates OTC&rsquo;s Health and Wellness Center.</p>
<p>Staff and administration officials have held a number of meetings to discuss everything from an extensive prevention information campaign to the actual distribution of the vaccine.</p>
<p>Prevention signs have already gone up on all the campuses and education centers to remind people that some of the simplest acts can improve one&rsquo;s chances of not getting or spreading the disease:</p>
<p>&bull;Wash your hands after using the bathroom</p>
<p>&bull;Sneeze into the bend of your elbow.</p>
<p>&bull;Cover your hand when you cough and then immediately wash your hands.</p>
<p>&bull;Avoid hand-to-hand contact when possible.</p>
<p>Everything from computer keyboards to the vending machine buttons are being cleaned thoroughly to avoid the spread of the disease through touching.</p>
<p>Students are also urged to stay home if they are sick or show symptoms.</p>
<p>Initially, a small allotment of N1N1 flu vaccine shots are expected to arrive on campus next month to give to the College&rsquo;s faculty, staff and students. More shots are expected to be available. A detailed distribution procedure is still being formulated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hopefully, we will be able to persuade them to pre-register for the H1N1 flu shots and accept them as soon as they are available,&rdquo; Blaine said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The spring semester issue of OTC Profile will be arriving in more than 270,000 area mailboxes soon.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The publication is filled with classes offered by our credit programs long with those available from our Community Enrichment Center and the Center for Workforce Development.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>In addition to the class listings, the magazine contains profile stories of six outstanding students from our campuses, centers and OTC Online.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The six students are:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&bull; Eric Oltman of Springfield is enrolled in the Allied Health program at the Springfield campus and is on his way to becoming a dental hygienist. He originally thought about entering the business world but after he earned his four-year business management degree, it was the health field that he decided to enter.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&bull; Markie Aldridge of Ozark attends the Richwood Valley campus and transformed her love for kids into a desire to be a teacher. After earning her Associate of Arts in Teaching degree this spring, she will transfer to Drury University to complete her studies.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&bull; Ashlee Warnock, a professional entertainer in Branson, has found balance between performing at two theaters, including the Andy Williams Moon River Theater, and taking a full load of classes at the Branson Education Center.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&bull; Michelle Wilson, an online student from Fordland, works in Rogersville and takes classes online to continue her education. Wilson says using OTC Online saves her a 45-minute one-way drive to take classes in Springfield and allows her to take management-training classes at her job.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&bull; Drew Bishop of Lebanon says he will miss the Lebanon Education Center when he transfers after the spring semester to Missouri State University. Drew also works as mathematics tutor at OTC and is a substitute teacher for the Lebanon School District.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&bull; Joshua Slack of Waynesville says that the opening the education center there was just what he needed to get his educational house in order. He is now studying business with an eye on eventually earning a four-year degree.</span></p>

                    <p>OTC&rsquo;s impact on the regional economy is the topic of the new issue of OTC Profile expected to reach mailboxes next week.</p>
<p>The publication contains stories that reflect the College&rsquo;s economic impact in a variety of ways. Comprehensive lists of the summer and fall schedules of credit courses, Community Enrichment classes and programs offered by the Center for Workforce Development also are carried inside the OTC Profile.</p>
<p>The stories are based on a recent economic impact study found that OTC contributed $211.8 million to its service region&rsquo;s economy. Students from outside the region who attended OTC spent $11.6 million annually in the region and OTC alumni who start businesses or get a job in the area, spend money and pay taxes, adding $58.4 million a year to the state&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The stories tell how OTC contributes to our community and how we can help prepare students for their future,&rdquo; said Hal L. Higdon, OTC president.</p>
<p>Featured in the publication are:</p>
<p>&bull; Marge Cheesman, director of Dynamic Strides and a graduate of the College&rsquo;s Occupational Therapy program. Her business in Republic offers physical therapy and hippotherapy. Most of the clients are children with various maladies including Down&rsquo;s syndrome, cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis.</p>
<p>&bull;Rick Hughlett, owner of Rick&rsquo;s Automotive, who has hired OTC graduates for his business and who watched the College grow to serve the region&rsquo;s needs. &ldquo;OTC has exceeded my expectations of what the college could mean for the region,&rdquo; Hughlett said.</p>
<p>&bull;CoxHealth and St. John&rsquo;s Health System executives both speak about how OTC&rsquo;s Allied Health programs&rsquo; graduates help fill the ranks of medical personnel needed in their systems. They also point to the quality of the OTC graduate in terms of preparedness for working in the Allied Health field.</p>
<p>&bull; Larry Hillhouse, owner of the Salon Moda in downtown Springfield. Moda sees the impact OTC students have on the downtown economy and is working to capture some of that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OTC is a great school to have so close to here. They really add to the business environment,&rdquo; he said.</p>

		<title>OTC purchases properties for future campus in Hollister</title>

                    <p><strong>SPRINGFIELD, MO. &mdash;</strong>The Board of Trustees of Ozarks Technical Community College has approved the purchase of two properties for a future campus in Hollister.&nbsp; The properties are located on Highway 165, which includes the former Crockey&rsquo;s restaurant and an adjacent parcel of land, both of which face Highway 65.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;We value the support and interest of all of the area property owners who have been a part of this process as we have weighed all the options.&nbsp; We believe we have selected the best location possible for this project,&rdquo; said Dr. Hal Higdon, president of Ozarks Technical Community College.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Crockey&rsquo;s property is 2.39 acres and was purchased for $848,000. The adjacent 5.86 acres was purchased for $1.4 million. The city of Hollister has agreed to donate another .83 acre of land adjacent to the two purchased properties, providing the College a total of 9.08 acres for the project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Citizens in the Hollister School District voted in April 2010 to join the Ozarks Technical Community College taxing district.&nbsp; Joining the OTC district allows Hollister residents to pay the in-district tuition to attend the College, which is significantly lower than the cost for students living outside of the district.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OTC appreciates the confidence of the voters in the Hollister school district, the Hollister school district and its Board of Education, the City of Hollister and its leadership, and the Hollister Chamber of Commerce,&rdquo; Dr. Higdon said. &nbsp;&ldquo;We look forward to enhancing the economic and workforce development in Hollister and the Table Rock Lake area.&rdquo;</p>

		<title>OTC relief effort brings out best in Ozarks</title>

                    <p>The southeast corner of OTC&rsquo;s Springfield campus at National Avenue and Chestnut Expressway has been abuzz with activity since Monday, less than 24 hours after a tornado tore a destructive path through Joplin.</p>
<p>Since then, the good-hearted people of the Ozarks have brought tens of thousands of dollars in cash and tons of vital goods to that corner.</p>
<p>By Friday, OTC collected $67,500 and sent nine tractor-trailers heaping with goods to Joplin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OTC is happy and proud to serve as a conduit between those who wanted to give and those in need in Joplin. The work of the volunteers and the generosity of those who gave speak volumes about the people of the Ozarks, who are always ready to lend a helping hand,&rdquo; said Dr. Hal L. Higdon, president of Ozarks Technical Community College.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;We also want to thank Prime Inc. and Jim Towery at Steelman Transportation for the use of several tractors to transport the items to Joplin. The effort of the Journal Broadcast Group played a big part in bringing people to campus. Without their contribution, the effort would not have been as successful as it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There have been many touching moments involving folks who have contributed or volunteered.</p>
<p>Monday night, an unemployed man dropped off a case of water. He said it was all he could afford.</p>
<p>Tuesday evening, the Girl Scouts showed up with 800 boxes of their trademark cookies.</p>
<p>Wednesday afternoon, Bingham Elementary dropped off $1,156 in bills and change.</p>
<p>Wednesday night, a little girl brought $31 in change that she had in four plastic sandwich bags and a green Easter egg.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the story of Tanya Willhite, 22, who graduated last week from Missouri State University. She was shocked when the tornado hit Joplin, where her friends and classmates lived. Tanya grew up in Carl Junction, just east of Joplin.</p>
<p>When she returned to Springfield Monday, where she lived while attending Missouri State, she learned of OTC&rsquo;s relief drive.</p>
<p>She came to OTC Tuesday to volunteer. She was here until we closed Wednesday night, too. But Thursday, she was absent. She had her gall bladder removed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad this is here and as soon as I get out of the hospital, I&rsquo;m going to Joplin to help there,&rdquo; she said.</p>

		<title>OTC sees growth explosion in GED program</title>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>Cindy Tuttle has never looked back from the decision she made more than 10 years ago.</p>
<p>After dropping out of high school and raising two children, Tuttle returned to school, earned her GED certificate at Ozarks Technical Community College but didn&rsquo;t stop there.</p>
<p>She continued her education at OTC, gained her Associates of Arts degree in business and went to work for the College 10 years ago, where she now is the Secretary to the Dean of Student Services.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could never see myself in college but I gave it a try,&rdquo; Tuttle said.</p>
<p>More and more area residents, victims of layoffs and business closings, are giving the GED program a try as they face a nearly impossible uphill climb to gain a job without a high school diploma.</p>
<p>Many are following Tuttle&rsquo;s path and using the free GED program at OTC to earn their high-school credential and as many as 10 percent continue their college education at OTC.</p>
<p>Ramona George, director of the GED and adult education programs at OTC, said 60 percent of those enrolled in the programs are unemployed and that all of OTC&rsquo;s sites where the GED training is offered have seen a 10 to 25 percent increase in enrollment over last year due to the economic downturn.</p>
<p>Last year, nearly 3,200 enrolled in GED classes and last May, a record 368 students earned their GEDs at OTC.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not necessarily all people who have been laid off taking GED classes. We see those people who just can&rsquo;t get a job. Employers are more choosy and are upping the job requirements,&rdquo; George said, adding that President Obama&rsquo;s recent call for Americans to continue their education has resonated with everyone at the College.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It tells us that the high school diploma or GED is not the end all to education.&nbsp; Getting a GED is still such an accomplishment but in some form or another, you&rsquo;ve got to go on with your education to be employable and make a living wage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The programs at OTC are funded with federal grants and for every dollar spent on the GED program, $9 are returned in the form of taxes paid by the educated graduate who finds a good-paying job.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The high school kids of today are tomorrow&rsquo;s taxpayers,&rdquo; George said.</p>
<p>GED recipients have motivational reasons to continue their education. Each recipient who gets their GED from OTC receives three free credit hours that can be used to take a college-level class at OTC.</p>
<p>Any student who scores 2,900 or better on the final GED test receives $900 a semester for four semesters to attend OTC. A perfect GED score is 4,000.</p>
<p>While GED and adult education classes are filling up, George said her office is working to accommodate everyone who needs help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bolivar has never been so busy. Many others centers are the same. There are waiting lists. But we&rsquo;re going to find a way to help everyone receive service,&rdquo; she said.</p>

                    <p>Inspiration is what drives Kateryna Wedlock in her quest to be the best graphic artist she can be.</p>
<p>And her inspiration and skills will be put to the test later this month when the OTC student competes in the national Skills USA competition in Kansas City as she tries to win a medal in competition with other winners from across the country.</p>
<p>SkillsUSA is a national organization serving trade, industrial, technical and health occupation students in high schools and community colleges.</p>
<p>Wedlock is one of 29 OTC students who have advanced to the nationals and head to Kansas City June 23-27.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a vast array of OTC programs and classes represented at nationals,&rdquo; said Don Reeves, OTC&rsquo;s faculty sponsor for the SkillsUSA group. &nbsp;&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t have had winners without strong instructors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reeves, after 21 years as the college&rsquo;s sponsor, is taking his last group of OTC students to nationals. Reeves is retiring from OTC.</p>
<p>Wedlock, who is from the Ukraine, came to OTC to study graphic arts after hearing about the college when she was an exchange student in Branson. In fact, it was the promotional ads that she saw on the racks in Branson stores and shops that piqued her interest in the program.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was fascinated with the ads and heard that it was Photoshop software that was used. I enrolled in OTC and enjoyed being surrounded by people so passionate about the same thing. They are inspiring, creative people,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Wedlock, 24, advanced through local, district and state competitions to advance to the national meet, where she will face off with others in the top two percent of their chosen field.</p>
<p>Wedlock&rsquo;s winning entry in the competition was a striking red, white and black poster designed to protest the slaughter of dolphins by Japanese fishermen. She has also designed the T-shirt Missouri students will wear in the competition.</p>
<p>At the nationals, however, Wedlock will have to be quick on her feet. She will have to take a rigid written test on graphic arts theory and then create a brand new logo and promotional flyer for a fictional company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have eight hours to create multiple versions of both,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Wedlock will be interning in Italy after the competition and then return to OTC in the fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be so happy to return and finish my studies and then maybe return to Europe to work,&rdquo; she said.</p>

                    <p>By Steve Koehler</p>
<p>January 30 was a devastating day for Anita Kelleybrew. It was the day she lost her job of 12 years at Positronic Industries.</p>
<p>But that day is in the past and the 41-year-old Kelleybrew is now looking ahead to a job in health information technology after she completes her studies at OTC.</p>
<p>Kelleybrew had been a student at OTC before, studying drafting when she was working at Positronic. When she was let go by the company, she tried to find another job in manufacturing after working for Zenith and General Electric before Positronic.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t until she talked to with OTC officials at the Missouri Career Center that she decided to look into a new career in healthcare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We started talking about maybe going back to school and changing careers. I was interested in health information technology,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Kelleybrew has started her studies that will take another year or more to complete. She is taking classes three days a week and using the College&rsquo;s tutoring facilities two days a week. She spends more than 40 hours a week on campus.</p>
<p>The Springfield woman isn&rsquo;t sure what she would be doing if she hadn&rsquo;t come to OTC.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d still be looking for a job but at OTC I&rsquo;ve been given an opportunity to pick a career,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p><strong>OTC office at the Missouri Career Center</strong></p>
<p>Bruce Clemens is OTC&rsquo;s workforce liaison who staffs the office at the Missouri Career Center. He meets with clients to discuss training and education options. Short-term training and degree programs are identified for client to put in a position that offers viable employment opportunities.</p>
<p>The typical client Clemens sees is a more non-traditional student between the ages of 35 and 60 with a 10- to 20-year work history at one, or at most, a few employers. The client needs basic computer literacy skills and is apprehensive about returning to school.</p>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>Bernadette Losh has one memory of her time as a student at Ozarks Technical Community that stands out from the rest, one that set the tone for her professional career.</p>
<p>It was the high standards set by Pam Carpenter, one of her nursing instructors when Losh attended in 1994.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was challenging but appropriate,&rdquo; said Losh, who graduated from OTC&rsquo;s licensed nursing program and went on to be director of clinics for Ozarks Community Hospital.</p>
<p>After earning her LPN degree at OTC, she went on to Evangel University where she earned a degree in business administration.</p>
<p>Losh, who graduated from Kickapoo High School in 1988, remembers the time when she was a nursing student and Carpenter found out Losh hadn&rsquo;t done a proper patient assessment before the patient went in for surgery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not do a head-to-toe assessment and she pulled me in the hall and explained the severity of my mistake. I never made that mistake again. She&rsquo;s serious. She&rsquo;s a great lady,&rdquo; Losh said.</p>
<p>Losh said the thing that&rsquo;s stayed with her from her days at OTC is the discipline she learned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really think it was the discipline that we had to have to get through the course. We had to stay on course and task-oriented,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>As the director of clinics, Losh oversees operations at all the clinics on the north Springfield campus including several specialty clinics with a total staff of about 60 employees. She has sat on OTC&rsquo;s allied health advisory board.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I would do it all over again in a heart beat. I&rsquo;m very much an advocate of OTC,&rdquo; she said.</p>

                    <p>Nicholas Ibarra</p>
<p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>Nicholas Ibarra believes community colleges offer people an opportunity and he took advantage of the chance Ozarks Technical Community College gave him when he was a student.</p>
<p>Ibarra, who also spent five years in the U.S. Marines, is the Zone 1 councilman on the Springfield City Council as well as a sales representative for RGA, a local industrial products company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had an excellent experience. I miss OTC, the campus atmosphere and the relaxed classroom setting,&rdquo; Ibarra said, who remembers macroeconomics being an &ldquo;eye-opening class&rdquo; that he took during his time at OTC.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was learning the real-world applications of the class.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra, who also spent five years in the U.S. Marines, is the Zone 1 councilman on the Springfield City Council as well as a sales representative for RGA, a local industrial products company.</p>
<p>Ibarra was familiar with OTC long before he started taking college classes in 2004. He took an auto mechanics class at the College when he was a student at Parkview High School.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I learned I didn&rsquo;t want to be an auto mechanic,&rdquo; Ibarra said.</p>
<p>Ibarra took all of his general education courses at OTC and then transferred to Evangel University, where he is working on his degree in business management.</p>
<p>Ibarra recently became interested in public affairs and won election to the Springfield council.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was always interested in the role of government and thought I could be effective at a community level,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>OTC is in the council zone that Ibarra represents and he likes what OTC contributes to the economic and educational needs of those in the area.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think one of the most important roles played by OTC is to connect to those who may not have any other opportunity to better their lives,&rdquo; he said.</p>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>Paul Sundy credits Ozarks Technical Community College with sending him on his way to professional and personal success.</p>
<p>The owner/operator of a number of Springfield&rsquo;s most popular restaurants and lounges including Big Whiskey&rsquo;s, Parlor Eighty Eight and Fedora&rsquo;s Social House, Sundy said OTC was &ldquo;the stepping stone that gave me the ability to more forward in my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An important step in his life came during his second semester at OTC. He met the woman who would become his wife, Crystal. They have two children, 4-year-old son Presley and 17-month-old daughter, Kinley.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;When I attended OTC that was when I really started to fall in love with the Springfield area,&rdquo; said Sundy, a graduate of Marionville High School and who earned his Associate of Arts degree from OTC in 2001.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Sundy spent some time searching for a career before going into business for himself. He went to California to try acting and worked as a bartender at an upscale restaurant while living out West.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> But Sundy came home to the Ozarks and opened his first business, Icon nightclub, in 2003. From then on, it was all business as Sundy opened Big Whiskey&rsquo;s American Bar and Grill in 2005, Parlor Eighty-Eight Lounge in 2007 and Fedora Social House and a Big Whiskey&rsquo;s in Little Rock in 2008.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> And soon, a second Parlor Eighty-Eight will open along with the first Missouri licensing agreement of Arkansas&rsquo; famous Whole Hog Caf&eacute;, which serves world championship barbecue.<br /> <br /> More businesses are on the way, Sundy said. His 10-year plan calls for opening between 15 and 30 more restaurants under the Parlor Eighty-Eight and Big Whiskey&rsquo;s names.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> A key player in the revitalization of downtown Springfield, Sundy said OTC was good for him since he admits he wasn&rsquo;t the best student.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> &ldquo;OTC was the first thing I completed since high school. The small class sizes helped. You weren&rsquo;t swallowed up by the bigger university and it was affordable,&rdquo; he said. <br /> &nbsp;<br /> It was during those formative years at OTC and after that Sundy developed his business philosophy and formula for success.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> &ldquo;My business philosophy is you have to be willing to take yourself out of your comfort zone and when people smarter than you talk, listen,&rdquo; he said.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to be the best at what you do. You just have to be willing to work harder than the other guy. Do what someone else has done, only better.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>Ozarks Technical Community College gave Ryan Nicholls the academic spark he needed to send him on his way to becoming Greene County&rsquo;s top emergency official.</p>
<p>Nicholls, the county&rsquo;s director of emergency management for the past three years, came to OTC to get his GED after leaving Willard High School. Nicholls earned a GED scholarship that paid for several semesters of college courses at OTC.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OTC helped me get started. It excited me academically and led me to know what I wanted was a master&rsquo;s degree,&rdquo; said Nicholls, who is 33, married and the father of five children.</p>
<p>After three semesters at OTC, Nicholls spent two years on a church mission in South America. When he returned, Nicholls resumed his studies and eventually earned his master&rsquo;s in emergency management.</p>
<p>Nicholls fondly remembers his time at OTC from 1993-94.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can probably honestly say that the majority of college instructors who standout in my mind were from OTC. They applied the subject to us in a way that made it easier for us to study. There was a motivation to study and we enjoyed doing it,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>While his original training was in nursing, it was his attraction to helping others in natural disasters that drew him to his current career. Nicholls spent six weeks in southern Mississippi after Hurricane Katrina hit.</p>
<p>His career choice was a good one that he credits in part to his time at OTC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I got confidence at OTC. I knew getting a master&rsquo;s was achievable and that I could go as far as I wanted to go,&rdquo; Nicholls said.</p>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>Ozarks Technical Community College continues to see substantial enrollment growth in the midst of the current economic downturn.</p>
<p>Four-week numbers for the spring semester show enrollment up 7.2 percent overall from last spring with a total of 10,617 students taking classes. Total credit hours increases to 101,686, or 8.6 percent, this spring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe that half of the increase is based on the hard times we are in and half is due to OTC continuing to meet the needs of people in our service area,&rdquo; said Dr. Hal Higdon, president of OTC</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it shows that when the times are tough, they know that going to a community college is the best thing they can do to improve their lives. More education and training are going to help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The College saw growth at its main campus as well as at its other education centers, at the Richwood Valley campus in Christian County and within its online offerings.</p>
<p>&bull; Branson/Hollister Education Center: 320 enrolled, up 25.5 percent</p>
<p>&bull; Lebanon Education Center: 361 enrolled, up 2 percent</p>
<p>&bull; Waynesville Education Center: 120 students (first spring semester of classes)</p>
<p>&bull; Richwood Valley campus: 807 enrolled, up 19.6 percent</p>

</ul>
<p>&bull; Online courses: 1,177 enrolled, up 36.1 percent.</p>
<p>&bull; Main campus: 7,545 enrolled, up 4.9 percent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In these difficult economic times, it is even more important for higher education to be convenient, accessible, and affordable for all.&nbsp; The College strives to support the local economies of communities within the service region through high quality workforce, technical, and general education,&rdquo; said Dr. Sue Moore, dean of extended campuses and college outreach.</p>
<p>Dr. Higdon said it has been the College&rsquo;s No. 1 priority to offer students what they need to earn a degree or certificate and gain employment. This is all done with minimum cost to taxpayers with the lowest local tax rate in the state, he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are doing more with less more than any other school in the state. I think that says a lot about how<strong><em> </em></strong>we operate OTC ,&rdquo; Dr. Higdon said.</p>
<p>And, according to Dr. Higdon, the College will continue to be the portal through which students can improve their employment chances and help turn the economy around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In an economy where the wheels are<strong><em> </em></strong>in danger of coming off, we are the<strong><em> </em></strong>mechanics that can keep the car running. People can&rsquo;t get jobs without proper training and it only makes sense to come to a community college like OTC to get that training,&rdquo; he said.</p>

		<title>OTC student become nurse as payback for care</title>

                    <p>The term &ldquo;pay it forward&rdquo; has not been lost on Matt Lyons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The OTC student was on his way to earning his law degree in Oklahoma last year when he was stricken with what doctors determined was the most severe form of diverticulitis, a disease that attacks the intestines and colon.</p>
<p>Lyons, a Springfield resident, was hospitalized for three months, including two in Cox South. His plans for a law degree were put on hold as Lyons pondered his future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a lot of time to think in a hospital. You evaluate your life. I was at a crossroads and had to determine what I wanted to do,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Lyons, who has been afflicted with a mild case of cerebral palsy since birth, decided he wanted to help people just like he was helped during his extended illness.</p>
<p>In January, Lyons enrolled in OTC&rsquo;s hybrid certified nurse assistant program and will graduate this week. He interviewed for two positions last week and has accepted a job to be a CNA on the same floor at Cox South were he was treated when Lyons was hospitalized for two months.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I realized the nurses and the CNAs around me were having a tremendous impact on my life. So I asked myself, &lsquo;Why not do that?&rsquo;&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Lyons, who holds a bachelor&rsquo;s degree from Evangel University and a master&rsquo;s from St. Louis University, said community colleges were never on his radar until he started considering where to get a nurse&rsquo;s education.</p>
<p>Today, Lyons is one of the biggest cheerleaders for what community colleges and OTC do for people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before this, I took OTC for granted. This all highlighted what OTC does for this area and what community colleges do for the country. They taught me skills to enter the workforce and to get a good job. Having OTC is a huge plus for our community,&rdquo; Lyons said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;The Community Enrichment Center that offers the hybrid CNA class does yeoman&rsquo;s work helping people find their niche.&rdquo;</p>

                    <P>Two years ago, Amado Antonini and his brother, Robert, came to Ozarks Technical Community College from Venezuela to get their GED. </P>
<P>Now, after two years in the College's Honors program, Amado Antonini is about to continue on his dream to become an engineer. He received word by email earlier this month that he had been accepted for the fall enrollment at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology</P>
<P>Antonini is the first OTC student to win a place in the prestigious educational institution.</P>
<P>"I am super excited. I can't believe it. If you told me when I came here that I'd be here today talking about going to MIT, I wouldn't believe it but we've done it," he said.</P>
<P>Antonini, who worked as a tutor in the Speckman Tutoring and Learning Center and has a 4.0 GPA, had perfect scores on the SAT's mathematics and physics tests that led to his admission at MIT.</P>
<P>"I studied to solve the problems. It took me a month of studying along with studying the formulas for physics," he said.</P>
<P>Todd Yerby, director of the honors program, said he's confident Antonini will do well at MIT.</P>
<P>"Transferring to MIT will be an exciting experience for Amado.&nbsp; He will do very well there and I can't wait to see what the rest of his college and professional paths will hold," Yerby said</P>
<P></P>
<P>When Atonini, who will likely study mechanical engineering, found out he had been accepted, his brother was almost more excited than he was.</P>
<P>"I was trying to take it all in and Robert was jumping all around," Amado said.</P>
<P>The brothers came to the area two years ago to get an American education and came to OTC because of mutual friends they had living in Bolivar. They share an apartment in Springfield. They've shared a few classes together but never sat together in class.</P>
<P>Heading to MIT later this summer will be an exciting time for Amado but also a sad time. He will have to be separated from his brother for the first time since they came to America.</P>
<P>"That's a downside," Amado said. "I have to leave everyone I met. We have a nice group of people from the calculus and physics classes who are friends. I will come back and visit," he said.</P>
<P>Amado will leave with a fondness in his heart for OTC, which was the springboard for his educational future and possible career.</P>
<P>"Everywhere I went on campus somebody wanted to help me. I would recommend OTC to anyone. It's all good here," he said.</P><I>

		<title>OTC student opens business, plans to hire OTC grads</title>

                    <p>As a student in OTC&rsquo;s Culinary Arts program, Lori Saviello has plenty on her plate.</p>
<p>She attends and teaches at OTC, is married with seven children and just opened a catering business &mdash; Saviello&rsquo;s Sweet &amp; Savory Catering. Her business has been selected as the preferred caterer for the Elfindale Mansion and Bed and Breakfast in Springfield.</p>
<p>As the owner, Saviello also has made a pledge that will allow her to give back to the college. In the future, she will offer jobs to OTC culinary students, who told her they were having trouble getting their foot through the kitchen door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t get a job without some experience but they can&rsquo;t get experience without a job. I want to give them both,&rdquo; Saviello said.</p>
<p>Saviello said she feels the need to give back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OTC inspired my passion in cooking. By coming to school and learning techniques, it made me more positive of myself,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;At a recent tasting event at Elfindale, OTC students served as butlers, passing out trays of food. One of those helping out was Nathan Frazo, an OTC student who won the national SkillsUSA contest in culinary arts. He wants to go to work for Saviello.</p>
<p>Saviello, the business&rsquo; only employee, admits starting a business is chancy. She&rsquo;s &ldquo;taking baby steps&rdquo; early on but knows getting into the food business was inevitable.</p>
<p>After watching her mother and grandmother cook for years, Saviello went to work in fast food at age 16 and stayed for 12 years. She swore then that she wouldn&rsquo;t cook again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But working with food was so deep inside me, I had to cook. Cooking is an art and the plate is my palate,&rdquo; said Saviello, who eventually enrolled at OTC.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t come to OTC, I don&rsquo;t think I would have been involved in food.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>H.J. Schumer is not only a student at OTC but also an artist, photographer, instructor and chef.</span></p>
<p><span>On Friday, Schumer will display some of his talents at the OTC Fine Arts Gallery as part of the November Art Walk event.</span></p>
<p><span>Schumer&rsquo;s photo exhibit will include pictures he&rsquo;s taken himself and others that he has helped design for local photographer Tom Davis. Some of Schumer&rsquo;s multi-media art that has been displayed at the Watercolor USA show at the Springfield Art Museum, also will be shown Friday.</span></p>
<p><span>Food and photography have always been part of Schumer&rsquo;s life. At one time, he worked for a local newspaper shooting pictures along with cooking at a restaurant.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;After losing several jobs to businesses that closed, I decided to do something I loved. I went into cooking and catering. I was approached by Tom Davis to do some food styling for him,&rdquo; Schumer said.</span></p>
<p><span>Together, Schumer and Davis produced photographs for companies such as Bass Pro, French&rsquo;s and Eagle Brand products. </span></p>
<p><span>It was Schumer&rsquo;s wife, Kim, who convinced her husband that he should get some &ldquo;culinary credibility&rdquo; and enroll in OTC&rsquo;s Culinary Arts program. This semester he is working in the student-operated Scallions restaurant.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;She said if I wanted to do food photography, I had to go back and get a culinary degree,&rdquo; he said. He graduates from OTC in May with an associate&rsquo;s degrees in culinary arts and baking.</span></p>
<p><span>Schumer, who works as an in-house chef and acting manager of the cooking school at the Price Cutter Bistro on Republic Road, said that getting his culinary education at OTC has been a big help.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;It has made a difference. I can visualize what&rsquo;s needed for a picture. I&rsquo;ve learned about creating a variety of dishes. I&rsquo;ve learned that baking is a science and cooking is an art,&rdquo; he said.</span></p>

                    <P>Sarah Byrd would like to be a chef who teaches as well as cooks for people so they can learn and appreciate the healthy side of food.</P>
<P>"My goal is community outreach and educating people," the 23-year-old OTC culinary arts student said.</P>
<P>But first, Byrd will pack her knives and lead a contingent of 24 OTC students to the national SkillsUSA competition June 24-28 in Kansas City.</P>
<P>SkillsUSA is a national nonprofit organization serving teachers, high school and college students who are preparing for careers in trade, technical and skilled service occupations, including health occupation. It was formerly known as VICA (Vocational Industrial Clubs of America).</P>
<P>Students compete in several categories that include both tests of hands-on skills and a written test.</P>
<P>"The leadership skills students learn will be invaluable in the world of work," said Cindy Phillips, lead SkillsUSA advisor at OTC.</P>
<P>For Byrd, she will be required to prepare a soup, salad and entrée from yet-to-be disclosed food products.</P>
<P>For the past few weeks, she has been practicing in the OTC culinary arts kitchens honing her knife skills and cooking abilities by breaking down proteins, making soups and pasta dishes.</P>
<P>Byrd won the state competition several weeks ago. It was the first time she entered the event.</P>
<P>"I am practicing whatever I think I will need to do my work. You won't know until you get there what you will have to work with," she said. "I am awesome with vegetables."</P>
<P>Chef Paul Trout of OTC's culinary arts staff said Byrd wants to take what she is learning at OTC and help others.</P>
<P>"She has a natural talent in the kitchen. She has a beautiful outlook on life and will succeed in any life path," he said.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Byrd, who moved to Springfield when she was six, said her research has brought her to the conclusion that people need to know more about food and where it comes from.</P>
<P>Byrd is also studying hospitality management and knows opening a restaurant is a huge undertaking. She also wants to study massage therapy and get her yoga certificate to do life coaching.</P>
<P>"My food puts health first," she said.</P>
<P></P>
<P> </P>

		<title>OTC students honored at MCCA state  convention</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
                    
                    <P>Two OTC students were presented with the Missouri Community College's Student Leadership Award last week during the MCCA convention in Kansas City.</P>
<P>Fran Ferguson and Christina Polosky earned the awards based both on their grade point average and their outstanding leadership qualities throughout their time at OTC. Both are members of Phi Theta Kappa.</P>
<P>MCCA's Student Leadership Award is presented annually to an exceptional student leader from each of Missouri's community colleges.&nbsp;Their college administrators recommend students for the award.</P>
<P>Ferguson, past president of the college's Student Government Association, said she was surprised to learn that she had won the top state award.</P>
<P>"I didn't even know I was nominated. I was totally shocked. College hasn't been easy for me all of the time with working, going to class and being involved as a student leader. It's nice to be recognized," said Ferguson, who has a 3.735 GPA.</P>
<P>Polosky, life Ferguson, was not aware the award was coming.</P>
<P>"I was shocked and amazed and incredibly honored. I had no idea this was coming. It made the hard work worthwhile," she said.</P>
<P>Ferguson, who is working in the college's student affairs office while going to class, said she plans to attend the Walt Disney World College Program as a character and then move to Hollins University in Roanoke, Vir., next fall to complete a bachelor's degree in psychology and communications. After that, she hopes to move on to Gonzaga University in Spokane, Wash., to finish her master's and doctorate in positive psychology and leadership studies.</P>
<P>"One day, I hope to be a life coach specializing primarily in leadership development, financial counseling and relationship counseling," she said.</P>
<P>Polosky, who attends classes at the OTC Richwood Valley campus and has a 4.0 GPA, will graduate with an associate of arts degree in teaching and hopes to go on to Drury University to complete her education degree.</P>
<P>Her goal is to be a math tutor.</P>
<P>"I found I have this ability to explain math concepts to people really well," Polosky said. "I enjoy it when people have an 'ah-ha' moment and are able to see how to figure out a math problem. It's fun."</P>

                    <SPAN lang=EN>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Two OTC students were presented with the Missouri Community Colleges Student Leadership Award last week during the MCCA convention in Kansas City.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Fran Ferguson and Christina Polosky earned the awards based both on their grade point average and their outstanding leadership qualities throughout their time at OTC. Both are members of Phi Theta Kappa.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>MCCAs Student Leadership Award is presented annually to an exceptional student leader from each of Missouris community colleges.Their college administrators recommend students for the award.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Ferguson, past president of the colleges Student Government Association, said she was surprised to learn that she had won the top state award.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>I didnt even know I was nominated. I was totally shocked. College hasnt been easy for me all of the time with working, going to class and being involved as a student leader. Its nice to be recognized, said Ferguson, who has a 3.735 GPA.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Polosky, life Ferguson, was not aware the award was coming.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>I was shocked and amazed and incredibly honored. I had no idea this was coming. It made the hard work worthwhile, she said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Ferguson, who is working in the colleges student affairs office while going to class, said she plans to attend the Walt Disney World College Program as a character and then move to Hollins University in Roanoke, Vir., next fall to complete a bachelors degree in psychology and communications. After that, she hopes to move on to Gonzaga University in Spokane, Wash., to finish her master's and doctorate in positive psychology and leadership studies.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>One day, I hope to be a life coach specializing primarily in leadership development, financial counseling and relationship counseling, she said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Polosky, who attends classes at the OTC Richwood Valley campus and has a 4.0 GPA, will graduate with an associate of arts degree in teaching and hopes to go on to Drury University to complete her education degree.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Her goal is to be a math tutor.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>I found I have this ability to explain math concepts to people really well, Polosky said. I enjoy it when people have an ah-ha moment and are able to see how to figure out a math problem. Its fun.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P></SPAN>

                    <p>Dylan Durrington can&rsquo;t wait for next year&rsquo;s SkilsUSA competition when  the OTC student wants a chance to defend the gold medal he received a  few weeks ago at the national competition.<br /><br />&ldquo;I cannot wait to compete again next year. It&rsquo;s one of those things that I will be doing again,&rdquo; he said.<br /><br />Durrington  and 11 other OTC students took home either a gold, silver or bronze  medal in the competition held recently in Kansas City, where more than  6,000 students from across the country competed in various areas of  career and technical education in 94 different trade, technical and  leadership fields.<br /><br />The OTC team of Durrington, Tess Bankston, Mathew Shuey and Alex Wirges won gold medal honors in the Broadcast News competition.<br /><br />In  that competition, students had to pick from 27 different news stories  to create a three-minute broadcast in a two-hour time period. They also  had to produce scripts and arundown sheet of what stories would be used.<br /><br />Durrington credits his OTC instructors for the team&rsquo;s success.<br /><br />&ldquo;They  taught me all the basic necessities needed in a studio environment and  how to write a tech sheet, how to behave on and off camera, how to  format news and how to be a friendly and conversational news anchor,&rdquo; he  said.<br /><br />Bankston, who attended Willard High School and will be  transferring to Missouri State University in the fall, said she didn&rsquo;t  get nervous until she saw the competition.<br /><br />&ldquo;When you realize  you&rsquo;re competing against 20 or more other teams, you realize that there  are other people who are good at what they do. All you can do is focus  on your team,&rdquo; she said.<br /><br />&nbsp;&ldquo;It was a great competition,&rdquo; said Dana  Gambriel, an instructor in the OTC Electronic Media Production program.  &ldquo;We had some amazing teams and the kids stepped up big time.&rdquo;<br /><br />OTC&rsquo;s  Video Product Development team of Kyle Hammett and Jacob McKnight also  won gold medals along with Ryan Williams in Computer Programming.<br /><br />Other OTC medal winners include:<br /><br />&bull; Stacy Walter, Action Skills, silver medal<br /><br />&bull; Jamie Danzer, Pamela Spickard and Monique Russell, Career Pathways &ndash; Human Services, silver medal<br /><br />&bull; Ashley Kelley, Preschool Teaching Assistant, bronze medal<br /><br />Steve Koehler is coordinator of media relations at Ozarks Technical Community College</p>

                    <P>It wasn't so much word of mouth as it was the yummy taste of cake in the mouth of many that convinced two OTC students to open a commercial bakery later this year.</P>
<P>Rebecca Gibbs and Marchelle Jaramillo, both culinary arts students at OTC, plan to open M&amp;R Bakery on West Commercial Street in December, where they will specialize in custom-made-to-order cakes, cupcakes and cookies. </P>
<P>It was their ability to make those tasty treats for friends and relatives that convinced they to take their talents to the business world.</P>
<P>"We've been doing it for family and friends for some time. Just over the last year, we've had such a demand from them that now it's been starting to go beyond only that," Gibbs said. </P>
<P>"We've had to tell people we can't do their orders yet. We dont have an actual kitchen. We can't go beyond family and friends right now. We are having that continual push by people that we don't even know who have tried stuff at our family or friends' parties."</P>
<P>Gibbs and Jaramillo met at OTC about two years ago when they were preparing for the SkillsUSA competition that pits area college students in various contests in their area of study.</P>
<P>"We found we both liked baking all sorts of things including breads, cakes and cupcakes and decided to take the plunge and go into business for ourselves," said Gibbs, who said her forte is breads.</P>
<P>Gibbs, from San Diego, came to the Ozarks as a child and used to bake with her mother and now is the chief cook and baker for her family. Jaramillo came to OTC to study nursing but took a Saturday baking class and immediately switched her major.</P>
<P>Both attribute a lot of what they learned about baking and the business world to their OTC education.</P>
<P>"The hospitality and catering classes helped me learn how to price out menus and take care of groups," Jaramillo said. "We learn a lot in the classes. The faculty is so helpful."</P>
<P>Said Gibbs: "The classes have been encouraging for me and motivational. Ive learned a lot. Menu design class helps me properly price out our recipes. Baking classes help me understand the science of baking."</P>
<P>The pair's Web site is a mandrbakery.com and can be found on Facebook at Facebook.com/mandrbakery.</P>

                    <p>Two Ozarks Technical Community College students have combined their talents to create a new children&rsquo;s water conservation booklet for the United States Department of Agriculture.</p>
<p>The booklet &mdash;&nbsp;&ldquo;Skeeter&rsquo;s Awesome Adventure&rdquo; &mdash;&nbsp;is the work of Debbie Hunter, who wrote the story, and Alicia Michael, who did the illustrations and for children in preschool through third grade.</p>
<p>Ironically, while the book has been in the works for several years, author and illustrator had never met until earlier this week when they appeared together at a meeting of the OTC Board of Trustees.</p>
<p>Hunter wrote the story as part of an early childhood department partnership between the USDA-Natural Resources Conservation Service, South Missouri Water Quality Project and children&rsquo;s literature class taught by Donna Graham.</p>
<p>It is the third USDA book produced by Graham&rsquo;s students.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Trash in Chigger County&rdquo; was published last year and &ldquo;The Little Acorn&rdquo; was printed in 2008. It will be distributed statewide.</p>
<p>In the story, Skeeter the mouse is outside playing in his sandbox when he is visited by a water drop that takes him on a journey through the water cycle.</p>
<p>This is the first book Hunter has written, which took her about two hours to complete.</p>
<p>Michael&rsquo;s illustrations of the story were chosen from a number of ideas submitted by OTC 2D art class students.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very proud of Alicia and all the students who submitted designs over the last two years. Alicia alone spent 200 plus hours creating her whimsical illustrations,&rdquo; said Kat Allie, art instructor who oversaw the illustration selection process.</p>
<p>Michael was happy her drawings were selected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to go into environmental sciences. It&rsquo;s a great foot in the door,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The booklet will be distributed through each county&rsquo;s USDA service center. A total of 15,000 copies will be printed. To obtain the booklet, call the Greene County Center at 831-5246 or go to www.mo.nrcs.usda.gov and click on the &ldquo;Find a Service Center&rdquo; link.</p>

                    <div class="pr_imagewrapper">/car_shot.jpg</div>
                    <SPAN lang=EN>
<P dir=ltr align=left>At first glance, it's hard to imagine that the remains of the gleaming white vehicle could be good for anything.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>But thanks to some talented OTC students, working in partnership with Mercy Hospital, the new Mercy Orthopedic Hospital being constructed at U.S. 65 and Evans Road now has a unique new piece of rehabilitation equipment.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Mercy, which opens the new facility next year, took delivery last week of a white SUV that was customized for use by orthopedic patients who will need training in getting in and out of a vehicle.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"Returning to routine activities like getting into a car can create anxiety for patients after major knee and hip replacement surgeries," said David Globig, Mercy Springfield vice president of operations. "The car will assist our orthopedic team in ensuring every patient is comfortable before they return home."</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>The vehicle was hoisted through an opening that eventually will become an outside wall on the third floor of the facility. The SUV is on rollers and can be moved as work in the rehab room continues.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>The father of a student donated the vehicle to OTC after it stopped running. It was repaired by OTC automotive students and used for a time by OTCs Safety and Security. Then, it was turned over to the automotive and welding programs.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Mercy officials contacted Kerry Wrinkle, chairman of the Colleges Transportation Department, about converting the vehicle into a piece of rehab equipment and students in welding and automotive collision repair worked on it during the spring semester.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>The axles, tires, engine, engine compartment and transmission were removed and rollers added to allow for it to be moved easily.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Globig says Mercy is thankful for all the time, energy and resources the students put in to the project.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"It was a win-win for OTC and Mercy," Wrinkle said. "The students in a number of automotive and welding programs were able to use the renovation project as a way to learn more about their fields of study, and Mercy has a new piece of equipment they can put to use for their patients. We were happy to help."</P>

                    <p>By Steve Koehler</p>
<p>Students at Ozarks Technical Community College are doing their part to make Christmas a little brighter for some of our military members in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Through November, members of various student organizations have been collecting items for &ldquo;Operation Thank You&rdquo; that will fill boxes heading to soldiers in the U.S. Army 203<sup>rd</sup> battalion from Missouri.</p>
<p>The boxes will include wet wipes, Kool-Aid mix, lip balm, phone cards and thank you letters written by OTC&rsquo;s Middle College students.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wanted to do something to give back to the soldiers,&rdquo; said Jeremy W. Boyts, one of the students involved.</p>
<p>The Veterans of Ozarks Technical Community College student group has been spearheading the effort that should result in more than 100 boxes sent to the soldiers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We challenged student organizations to complete the 100-box goal, but we&rsquo;re pretty sure we&rsquo;re going to exceed that goal,&rdquo; Boyts said.</p>
<p>The public can do its part in the holiday effort on Nov. 30 when a fundraiser will be held from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. in the Information Commons Atrium to raise money to pay for shipping the boxes overseas.</p>
<p>Each box costs between $12 and $13 to ship, and with more than 100 boxes being filled, the effort needs more than $1,000. The public and students will be able to purchase food items and customized plastic wrist bands to commemorate the effort with all the proceeds going toward the shipping costs.</p>
<p>Local merchants, including the Billy Long Auction Co., The Deck Co., and Express Press, are contributing to the effort.</p>
<p>Beau T. Cruse, an OTC student from Willard, was injured while serving in Iraq. He wants to make the Operation Thank You an annual event.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the solider gets a box, we want to put a smile on his face and let them know somebody is thinking about them,&rdquo; he said.</p>

		<title>OTC students to compete for national honors</title>

                    <p>Some of OTC&rsquo;s top technical and service students will travel to Kansas City next month to compete among the nation&rsquo;s best for top honors in their fields of study.</p>
<p>The 20 OTC students will participate in the national SkillsUSA competition in Kansas City June 21, where state winners from across the country will vie for national honors in various categories including graphic communications, culinary arts, television production, computer programming and web design.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The competition is designed to build leadership skills and showcase students&rsquo; technical abilities,&rdquo; said Don Reeves, OTC&rsquo;s faculty sponsor for the SkillsUSA group.</p>
<p>SkillsUSA is a national organization serving teachers and high school and college students who are preparing for careers in technical, skilled and service occupations, including health occupations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only the top 2 or 3 percent of the students who competed get to nationals. There will be about 1,500 to 2,000 competitors. It&rsquo;s a big honor just to get to go,&rdquo; Reeves said.</p>
<p>Rob Page will represent OTC in the audio production division. He will have to research the commercial&rsquo;s topic, write a script and prepare a radio commercial within a designated time limit. His state entry concerned the Ozarks National Waterways.</p>
<p>Page, 22, who has audio production experience from playing in a local musical band, said the experience in SkillsUSA has made him a more productive person with a better outlook on life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I finally woke up and decided it was time to get motivated. I want to work in movies as a sound effects artist,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Clara Thompson will be competing in the food and beverage division. The Hillcrest High School graduate is competing on the national level for the first time.</p>
<p>The 19-year-old will have to set up a formal dining setting, memorize the dishes on a three-course menu, seat, greet and service judges as well as answer any questions they may have about what&rsquo;s being served, including how the food was prepared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s going to be pretty intense,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;At nationals, you compete against everyone who won state. The menus get harder; the grading gets harder,&rdquo; she said.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ozarks Technical Community College students and staff are responding to the call for help from victims of the devastating earthquake in Haiti.</p>
<p>A clothing drive, organized by Amy Thomas, Resource Counselor in the Disability Support Services department, has resulted in dozens of large, plastic bags of clothing being sent to earthquake victims and dozens more bags scheduled to be sent next week.</p>
<p>In addition to clothes, a large number of essential health and medical items, including toothbrushes, toothpaste, soap, peroxide and first-aid kits, have been contributed.</p>
<p>Thomas said a Branson hotel, which recently changed its name, contributed dozens of T-shirts that contained the old name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am amazed at how many responded so quickly.&nbsp; We work in a generous environment here. With all the media attention, everyone is aware of what happened and all want to help. They were happy to have a place to contribute,&rdquo; Thomas said, adding that she felt compelled to do something for the victims.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t imagine not doing something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The items are being sent to the French Speaking (Haitian) Baptist Church of St. Louis, which is sending the collections to Haiti. Thomas learned of the church&rsquo;s efforts through a friend.</p>
<p>Gently used summer clothing and non-emergency medical supplies will continue to be collected until Feb. 11. Items can be brought to the Disability Support Services office, Information Commons East, Room 127, or by contacting Thomas at thomasam@otc.edu.</p>
<p><em>Steve Koehler is coordinator of publications for Ozarks Technical Community College. He can be contacted at </em>koehlers@otc.edu.</p>

		<title>OTC to be home to new hearing aid program</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
                    
                    <p>Ozarks Technical Community College will be the first college in the state to offer a two-year degree in hearing instrument science this spring.</p>
<p>In 2013, Missouri will begin requiring a two-year associate&rsquo;s degree for anyone who fits customers with a hearing aid. &nbsp;Previously, the only training available for this career was on-the-job training, frequently on just one specific make of hearing aid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This program will result in vast improvements in the quality of hearing healthcare since our graduates will be well-versed in the theory and practice of hearing improvement,&rdquo; said Stephen Bishop, Dean of Allied Health.</p>
<p>The Hearing Instrument Specialist program that OTC will offer will include hands-on laboratory training in a wide variety of skills, as well as clinical internships with area specialists.</p>
<p>The program is being developed with funds from Gov. Jay Nixon&rsquo;s Training for Tomorrow program, a $12 million initiative to educate Missourians in high-tech fields and get them working in growing industries. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Larry Brethower, the program&rsquo;s director, is well known nationally and internationally for his work in advancing the field of hearing healthcare and is clinic director of the Springfield Hearing Center.</p>
<p>The program is intended to prepare graduates for immediate work, especially in southwest Missouri where there is a shortage of hearing instrument specialists due, in part, to the large demand from the area&rsquo;s retiree population in and around the Branson area.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A graduate can go to work for a company or be self-employed. Specialists can work their way up to a good living wage,&rdquo; Brethower said, adding that self-employed specialists can make upwards of $80,000 a year.</p>
<p>Brethower said the program is designed for someone looking for a career change or is looking to learn new skills.</p>
<p>Said Bishop: &ldquo;This program will be perfect for the person who wants a career that allows them to use technical skills and strong human relations skills in a way that makes a tremendous positive impact on the lives of others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brethower said the program would initially admit 5-10 students in the spring but that number could double depending on demand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to produce craftspeople who will meet the challenges of the hearing impaired,&rdquo; Brethower said.</p>
<p>Applications are being accepted for the first spring class. The deadline to apply is Nov. 20. &nbsp;To receive an application packet, call the Allied Health office at 447-8954.</p>

                    <p>Misi McFarland, an incoming first-year student at Ozarks Technical Community College, said it best.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My first class will be English Comp I on Aug. 23. I think on the night of the 22<sup>nd</sup>, I will sleep like a kid on Christmas Eve,&rdquo; she wrote on OTC&rsquo;s Facebook page.</p>
<p>Misi will be among thousands of nervous and excited students, faculty and staff on campus Monday as OTC welcomes another fall semester at its two campuses and three educational centers.</p>
<p>It seems hard to believe that just 20 years ago, voters approved the formation of the OTC service region and next year will mark the 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the first classes being offered.</p>
<p>Since that time, OTC&rsquo;s enrollment has grown to the point where having 13,000 students enrolled for the fall is the norm rather than the exception.</p>
<p>The college has grown from one campus in Springfield to two campuses, the second being Richwood Valley, located between Nixa and Ozark. There are three educational centers in Branson, Lebanon and Waynesville. All five locations will experience an increase in enrollment this fall.</p>
<p>Over the years, enrolling at OTC has grown into a tradition for many students.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As we approach our 20<sup>th</sup> year of educational service to the Ozarks, we now have students who don&rsquo;t remember a time when OTC wasn&rsquo;t here. We have established ourselves as an institution that provides a reasonably priced quality education that students can use to go right to work or continue on to a four-year institution,&rdquo; said Hal L. Higdon, president of Ozarks Technical Community College.</p>
<p>But OTC is not standing still; changes and improvements are constantly under way at the college.</p>
<p>This fall, a new parking lot on the west end of the Springfield Campus will accommodate another 410 vehicles, helping ease that situation.</p>
<p>A revamped cafeteria, now called Caf&eacute; 101, will offer students a variety of quality food offerings, a full coffee bar and soft drinks that include Coke, Pepsi and Crown products.</p>
<p>Work will begin soon on a second-floor addition to Information Commons West 100 that will add 10 classrooms for fall 2011.</p>
<p>And at the same time, Higdon said, the college also will continue to play a significant role on the region&rsquo;s economic stage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over the years, we have become a key economic catalyst through training workers and providing vital services to our business partners. Recently, OTC was designated as having the second-largest impact on the Ozarks in the last 30 years,&rdquo; Higdon said.</p>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>In 2003, when many higher education institutions and medical centers were talking about the issue of tobacco on their grounds, Ozarks Technical Community College was doing something about it by becoming the first U.S. college to ban all tobacco from its campuses and centers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The College founded the Center of Excellence for Tobacco-Free Campus Policy in 2004 and it has offered workshops, webinars and consulting services that more than 150 institutions have used to make their campuses tobacco-free.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The College&rsquo;s sixth annual &ldquo;Making Your Campus Tobacco-Free&rdquo; Workshop will be held at OTC June 19 with more than 25 groups from across the country attending, including the University of Kansas, the University of New England and Washington University in St. Louis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Presenters will include representatives from the University of Arkansas, the Onondaga County Health Department in Syracuse N.Y., and Ivy Tech Community College in Lafayette, Ind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The potential damage of exposure to carcinogens in second-hand smoke and the lack of respect for the impact of their behavior by tobacco users and others factors have resulted in a national trend to remove tobacco use from the campus environment,&rdquo; said Ty Patterson, director and founder of the OTC center.</p>
<p>Patterson and Dr. Jim Blaine will offer sessions on how to overcome resistance to tobacco-free policies and the role of advisory committees in getting tobacco-free policies put in place.</p>
<p>"The tobacco-free policy puts Ozarks Technical Community College at the forefront of student, employee and visitor health advocacy. As a pioneer in the tobacco-free movement, the College is leading through example and making our environment healthier and cleaner for all,&rdquo; said OTC President Dr. Hal L. Higdon.</p>

                    <p>By Steve Koehler</p>
<p>Leaders in higher education and health will gather at Ozarks Technical Community College next week for the seventh annual Tobacco-Free Campus Workshop May 26-27.</p>
<p>Approximately 20 institutions from around the country will gather for the event, sponsored by OTC&rsquo;s Center for Excellence for Tobacco-Free Campus Policy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tobacco-free policies continue to be an important issue on college campuses and other institutions. The annual workshop is one of several ways the Center of Excellence for Tobacco-Free Campus Policy helps those interested in making their outdoor spaces tobacco-free,&rdquo; said Ty Patterson, director of the OTC center for excellence.</p>
<p>During the two-day workshop, attendees will hear from a number of experts in health and education and discuss ways to help make colleges, universities and other institutions tobacco-free.</p>
<p>Sara Plaspohl with the Memorial Health University Medical Center in Savannah, Ga., will present the results of her doctoral dissertation&rsquo;s assessment of the impact tobacco-free policies have had on the country&rsquo;s colleges and universities.</p>
<p>A total of 162 of the 175 colleges and universities with tobacco-free policies responded to Plaspohl&rsquo;s survey. The results show that &ldquo;tobacco-free schools fall short of total compliance with current American College Health Association guidelines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still, Patterson said, the interest among institutions looking to institute tobacco-free policies grows, as does the popularity of the workshop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been gratifying to see the growth of the tobacco-free workshop these past six years. From the evaluations of the participants, we know we are helping institutions across the country learn how to develop, implement and sustain tobacco-free campus policies,&rdquo; Patterson said.</p>
<p>Patterson will head a discussion with hospital leaders discussing efforts to implement and enforce tobacco-free policies on their campuses.</p>
<p>Representatives from Cox Health Systems, St. John&rsquo;s Medical Center and Memorial Health University Medical Center in Savannah, Ga., will be involved in the roundtable talk.</p>

		<title>OTC to offer free citizenship classes in fall</title>

                    <P></P>
<P>Do you know the answers to the following?</P>
<P> What are the first 10 amendments to the U.S. Constitution called?</P>
<P> What economic system is used in the U.S.?</P>
<P> How many justices are on the U.S. Supreme Court?</P>
<P>If you don't know the answers, you might not pass the U.S. citizenship test that local immigrants study for at OTC every year.</P>
<P>The free classes will be held on Mondays and Wednesdays from 6-8:30 p.m. on the OTC Springfield Campus in Graff 121. The classes run through Oct. 23. Orientation and enrollment will be held Sept. 9 and Sept. 11. No enrollment will be allowed after Sept. 11.</P>
<P></P>
<P>"Our students want to do this and become citizens," said Ramona George, director of OTC's Adult Education and Literacy program. "We take them through all the elements required in the process."</P>
<P>Wenyan Drake of China recently became a citizen after attending classes at OTC. She is now taking an English as a Second Language class at OTC.</P>
<P>It took nearly six years for her to receive her permanent residency card from the U.S. in order to be eligible to take the test. </P>
<P>"I wanted to be a citizen," said Drake, who is married and has a 24-year-old daughter attending Drury University.</P>
<P>One of her favorite parts of being a citizen? Voting.</P>
<P>"Voting is part of being a citizen. It's the people's right to vote. In China, you can't vote for who you want. Here we can choose."</P>
<P>Fran Giglio, who teaches the citizenship class, said it costs about $900 to become a U.S. citizen and it's hard to get the green card necessary to become a citizen. </P>
<P>"Many get married to a U.S. citizen but you still must prove they are actually committed to the marriage through photographs, names on bills and a joint bank account," she said.</P>
<P>George said possible changes in the immigration laws could trigger an increase in the number of people attending the citizenship classes.</P>
<P>"Citizenship will be required under many of the new proposals so we should see an increase when that happens," she said.</P>
<P>By the way, the answers to the above questions: Bill of Rights, capitalist or market economy and nine.</P><I>

                    <p>As classes filled up for the fall semester at Ozarks Technical Community College, administrators began looking for a way to provide for those students who were unable to enroll in the classes they needed.&nbsp; The solution:&nbsp; for the first time in the College&rsquo;s history, OTC will offer Late Start Courses, or classes that begin after the semester is already underway.<br /><br />&ldquo;The need for additional courses became more clear as we realized we were not going to meet the demand with our existing schedule,&rdquo; said Dr. Hal Higdon, president of Ozarks Technical Community College.&nbsp; &ldquo;This innovative program will make it possible for more students to take the classes they need to keep their education on track.&rdquo;<br /><br />These classes will meet on Fridays and/or Saturdays beginning Friday, September 18, and will meet through the end of the semester.&nbsp; Class periods will be extended to offset the late start.&nbsp; The ten course offerings are primarily introductory and prerequisite classes, including Business, Allied Health, psychology, English composition and developmental math courses.<br /><br />&ldquo;On the last day of registration, we turned away a significant number of students who were too late to get the foundation classes they needed.&nbsp; We created the Late Start Courses as an opportunity to help those students progress in their education,&rdquo; explained Dr. Randy Humphrey, Vice President for Academic Affairs.&nbsp; &ldquo;This program is one more way that OTC is working to provide exactly what our students need, when they need it.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />For information about Late Start course offerings, registration dates and procedures, call 417-447-6900 or visit <a href="http://www.otc.edu">http://www.otc.edu</a>.</p>

                    <p>Winter remains the current season, but spring is on the minds of some at Ozarks Technical Community College.</p>
<p>Rehearsals have begun for the third Spring Play to be presented by the OTC Fine Arts Department.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Arthur&rsquo;s Stone, Merlin&rsquo;s Fire,&rdquo; will be performed April 30-May 2 at the Gillioz Theater. The cast is made up entirely of OTC students, faculty and family members of OTC employees.</p>
<p>The play is about young Arthur, who is surrounded by political strife, wars against foreign invaders and civil unrest. After pulling a mystical sword from a stone and declared emperor of Britain, the young king struggles to decide his fate as forces of good and evil attempt to influence him.</p>
<p>Set in the dark ages, playwright Kathryn Petersen delivers a fresh look at the &ldquo;sword in the stone&rdquo; myth, combining all the best elements of 1,500 years of the Arthurian legend &mdash;&nbsp;from fantastic sword fighting to magic to an enchanted forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Petersen delivers a play that is much truer to history, but sprinkles in enough magical wonder and fun to keep the attention of children as well as adults. She introduces a young King Arthur who's character and relationships might remind one of Harry Potter,&rsquo; said Jon Herbert, the play&rsquo;s director.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The play is a drama that contains a wonderful balance of action, humor, magic and mystery. It is an uplifting heroic drama that is fun, exciting, and inspiring.&rdquo;</p>

		<title>OTC trains City of Ozark workers in computer skills</title>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>City of Ozark officials say recent training some of their employees received from a customized course offered by Ozarks Technical Community College will save the city money now and in the future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The better job our workers can do, the more money we save. We are trying to give them the tools to be as efficient as possible. Being efficient will save the city money directly and indirectly,&rdquo; said Ozark City Administrator Steve Childers.</p>
<p>Approximately 16 Ozark workers received computer training recently in an effort to make the city&rsquo;s public works employees more efficient in the use of their computers on site.</p>
<p>Sherry Coker, workforce specialist business manager for OTC&rsquo;S Center For Workforce</p>
<p>Development, said she teamed with Lenette Hebrink, public works coordinator for the city of Ozark, to develop a customized computer application training program to meet the specific needs of the public works and sewer plant employees.</p>
<p>The 16-hour course, conducted at the College&rsquo;s Richwood Valley campus in Christian County, gave workers from the city&rsquo;s sewer and street departments training in how to enter and receive information while out of the office working on projects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are learning the basics in how to work on the computer and entering data correctly,&rdquo; Hebrink said.</p>
<p>The training program was organized after city officials met with Sherry Coker and Veronica Lowe of the College&rsquo;s Center for Workforce Development in June.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We worked with the city to develop a customized computer application training program to meet the specific needs of the public works and sewer plant employees,&rdquo; Coker said.</p>
<p>Once the workers receive the training, they will be able to use the laptops in their trucks and in other locations to enter data such as important information from the city&rsquo;s lift stations at the sewer plant.</p>
<p>Street maintenance workers can receive work orders on site if there is an urgent job to completed. Detailed information can be included in the report sent to the worker via the computer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our guy at the shop can get the information and send it to the workers,&rdquo; Hebrink said.</p>
<p>Childers said the employees were excited about the training they received.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were ecstatic about taking the class. The city had never offered any kind of training like this before. Anytime you can take advantage of an opportunity to work with a great organization like OTC in a customized class to educate and train employees, it&rsquo;s a win-win for everybody,&rdquo; Childers said.</p>
<p>John McCart, one of those who took the class, wrote to Childers to thank him for the opportunity to take the training.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the most HELPFUL class that I have had the opportunity to take. I hope the City of Ozark realizes that making people more familiar with computers will help productivity and save money in the long run,&rdquo; McCart wrote.</p>
<p>Childers said it&rsquo;s likely more training programs will be arranged between OTC and the city.</p>

                    <p>OTC&rsquo;s Turf and Landscape students are gaining valuable experience in their career choice by providing local community service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The students, members of the Professional Land Care Network (PLANET), recently completed an improvement project at the Valley Water Mill Watershed Center on Springfield&rsquo;s north side.</p>
<p>The group of 22 students planted and mulched around trees, cleared brush from wooded areas for erosion control and put down mulch on about 2.5 miles of area trails near the center.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It really gives us great practical, hands-on experience. We were able to learn proper mulching techniques, creek gravel replacement and recovering trails that had been covered over,&rdquo; said Terri Howard, president of OTC&rsquo;s student chapter of PLANET.</p>
<p>Getting to do the watershed center project was easy, Howard said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our instructor Rob Flatness has contacts and told us about what the center needed. We asked if we could come out to work on it,&rdquo; Howard said.</p>
<p>The program helped Howard discover that she has a love for trees and tree identification.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can remember them and just look at a tree and ID it,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Howard is now in her third year studying turf and landscape through the College&rsquo;s agriculture program.</p>
<p>As the new president of the group, Howard has been trying to get the chapter to do more and has some other projects planned. The group last week completed some general cleanup work earlier this month on the OTC Springfield campus and nearby Silver Springs Park, just north of the Springfield campus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next spring, we plan to do some work at the Springfield-Greene County Botanical Center in Nathaniel Greene Park. We&rsquo;re doing more community service. The hands-on experience for us is there to do and whoever we help gets the benefits,&rdquo; she said.</p>

		<title>OTC turns to summer semester registration</title>

                    <p>The ink is barely dry on the degrees handed out at Thursday night&rsquo;s commencement and thoughts have already turned to OTC&rsquo;s summer semester, which looks to be drawing a large number of students.</p>
<p>Scheduled to begin June 6, the semester&rsquo;s enrollment numbers are already up nearly 12 percent when compared to last year&rsquo;s enrollment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are so happy that students continue to choose OTC in large numbers to meet their educational needs. Summer is a great time to take classes and the numbers show we have a lot of students doing just that,&rdquo; said Joan Barrett, associate vice president for student affairs.</p>
<p>The same is true with fall enrollment, showing an early increase of nearly 9 percent over last year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Recent increases in student visits and tour requests show that enrollment is expected to track upward over the days and weeks ahead.</p>
<p>Student visits are made by those who are college students elsewhere and are coming to OTC to look into picking up a general education class or two during the summer and fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the first day of open registration earlier this month, we had well over 500 visiting student requests for summer and fall classes.&nbsp; Two weeks later, we continue to see a steady stream of those students,&rdquo; said Ginger Luke, assistant director for Advising and Online Student Services.</p>
<p>In addition to those visits, tour requests are up, too, said Vicki MacDonald lead admissions representative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have seen 30 scheduled tours since May 2,&rdquo; MacDonald said.</p>
<p>During a one-hour tour, students sometimes speak with an instructor from a specific area or they see all of the facilities and resources on campus. Tours are offered at the Springfield and Richwood Valley campuses.</p>
<p>To schedule a Springfield campus tour, call 447-2662 or to tour Richwood Valley, call 447-7931.</p>
<p>Once a student decides to attend OTC, they can go online to http://www.otc.edu/First-time-students.php and follow the steps listed there.</p>

		<title>OTC TV studio getting new look</title>

                    <P>Real world experience is the best kind of experience students can get when learning about a profession. The OTC's Electronic Media Production program is trying to bring some of that reality to its students.</P>
<P>A major makeover of EMP's TV production studio is scheduled to take place with the addition of a professional news studio set that students will be able to use in its studio TV production class.</P>
<P>"We dreamed of doing an actual broadcast. That's possible now with what we have," said Jeff Johnson, one of the EMP instructors.</P>
<P>Before the makeover was planned, the students sat at a long non-descript table with chairs in front of a green screen that would allow them to show pictures and graphics behind them. Now, thanks to the Construction Technology program, a professional-looking set will be built starting this week for the EMP students to use.</P>
<P>"We had priced prefabricated sections, which were expensive. Construction technology did it at a fraction of the cost. It was a concrete project for the construction," Johnson said. </P>
<P>While the EMP program doesnt emphasize the talking portion of broadcasts, doing them allows the students to learn about running cameras, directing, sound and other basics they need to be able to work at television stations.</P>
<P>Johnson worked at KSPR, the Springfield Cardinals and an independent production company before coming to OTC. Dana Gambriel, another EMP instructor, worked with Johnson at KSPR.</P>
<P>"I'm very excited for the kids who will get the experience of working on a more professional set. It's a great opportunity for everybody. We can simulate what it's like in the real world," Gambriel said.</P>
<P>The popularity of the program has been growing over the years thanks to increased interest in video and sound production. EMP now offers five sections of studio TV production classes. In addition, the program offers classes in 3-D animation, video game design, digital special effects and audio engineering.</P>
<P>"The addition of the news set will allow us to have some impressive esthetics to go along with the great equipment we already have," Johnson said.</P><I>

		<title>OTC welding class constructs tiger crate for zoo</title>

                    <!-- @font-face {   font-family: "Cambria"; }@font-face {   font-family: "American Typewriter"; }p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal { margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: "Times New Roman"; }a:link, span.MsoHyperlink { color: blue; text-decoration: underline; }a:visited, span.MsoHyperlinkFollowed { color: purple; text-decoration: underline; }div.Section1 { page: Section1; } -->
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Until this semester, Jim Bridwell and his welding students at Ozarks Technical Community College had never seen, much less built, a tiger crate.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>But when Dickerson Park Zoo officials recently asked if Bridwell and his students would be interested in the construction project. Bridwell said yes.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t know anything about tiger crates. We just knew they had to be strong,&rdquo; Bridwell said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>About a dozen welding students made a custom150-pound aluminum crate that measures 79.5 inches long, 29.5 inches wide and 40 inches tall that is being used</span><span> to securely haul large felines to and from the local zoo.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Don Tillman, the zoo&rsquo;s development director, contacted OTC about building the crate.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&ldquo;We said &lsquo;yes.&rsquo; We met with a zoo engineer and went to work,&rdquo; Bridwell said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Crocker Engineering of Springfield designed the crate according to zoo specifications. The drawings then were converted into working plans by OTC&rsquo;s drafting and design program.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The crate had a number of custom features, including a removable waste pan and chutes to provide water and food.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Jackson Thompson, tropical Asian keeper for the Dickerson Zoo, took the crate to the Cincinnati Zoo Wednesday to transport a Malayan tiger back to Springfield.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&ldquo;The crate looks great. It came together very well. The students have done a great job working on it, asking questions when they needed more information,&rdquo; Thompson said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The students worked on the construction of the crate for about three weeks before turning it over to Thompson Tuesday night.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a good experience for the students,&rdquo; Bridwell said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been learning how to work off of drawings. We&rsquo;re working for a customer who wants it to look good. It&rsquo;s a good experience of working for someone.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Landon McGilvry, one of the students overseeing the work, said the project was a nice change of pace for the class.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to know it&rsquo;s going to use in the community,&rdquo; McGilvry said.</span></p>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>People in need of reading, writing and computer skills continues to grow and Ozarks Technical Community College works to fill part of that vital need with volunteers who serve as literacy tutors.</p>
<p>Kathy Funk, literacy tutor coordinator at OTC, said the need for literacy tutors remains extremely high at OTC&rsquo;s adult education and literacy classes offered throughout the region.</p>
<p>Last year, 850 AEL students were functioning below a sixth-grade level in reading, English or math but only about one-third of them could be helped by the college&rsquo;s 40 active volunteer tutors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When people come to enroll in GED classes, we find that approximately one-third of these folks are not able to read, write or compute at levels necessary to study for the GED. These are people who are most in need and, often, a tutor can make a difference between someone continuing to pursue additional education and dropping out again,&rdquo; Funk said.</p>
<p>Volunteer tutors complete a free orientation and training program. Volunteers and students meet at the Adult Education and Literacy class sites around the region during regular hours. Schedules depend on areas of interest and student needs.</p>
<p>Brenda Woods began tutoring for OTC in May and did it because her son earned his GED with help from volunteer tutors. &ldquo;What a difference it made in his life. I was so thankful for the GED program and its volunteer tutors,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Woods said working with the students in the GED program is inspiring. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s motivating to hear where they&rsquo;ve come from, where they are now and where they want to go. Many have life-altering events to overcome. These students have a lot of courage and perseverance because it&rsquo;s easy to quit. I&rsquo;m thankful for the opportunity to help,&rdquo; she said.</p>

		<title>OTC, C of O to make transition for transfer student more efficient</title>

                    <p>College of the Ozarks (C of O) and Ozarks Technical Community College (OTC) are partnering to make the transition from the completion of an OTC Associate of Arts degree to a Bachelor of Arts for transfer students pursuing agriculture studies more efficient.&nbsp; The institutions entered a formal articulation agreement that designates certain credits earned at OTC to apply to specific College of the Ozarks course requirements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The purpose of this agreement is to help ensure a smooth transition when a student is admitted to C of O from OTC intending to major in agriculture,&rdquo; said Dan Swearengen, C of O chair of technical and applied sciences. &ldquo;This really helps the student, and most transfer students are proven and successful students when they are admitted to C of O.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This partnership with C of O expands the educational opportunities for our students&rdquo;, said Dr. Gavin O&rsquo;Connor, OTC&rsquo;s Assistant Dean of Sciences. &ldquo;OTC prides itself on working with many institutions to provide a seamless transfer to other educational institutions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to the agreement:</p>
<p>- Agriculture courses at OTC may count toward certain equivalent agriculture courses at C of O.</p>
<p>-A minimum grade of &ldquo;D&rdquo; in all courses must be maintained to qualify for transfer.&nbsp; Transfer grades of &ldquo;F&rdquo; will be counted in figuring cumulative grade averages but will not count toward C of O graduation requirements.</p>
<p>-Upon completion of the Associates of Arts degree (at OTC), the only remaining General Education courses required by C of O is REL 103 (Biblical Survey) and REL 343 (Biblical Theology and Ethics) or any other current additional General Education course(s) that have been added since the agreement and are unique to C of O.</p>
<p>- This agreement does not guarantee admission to C of O. OTC students must still proceed through the application and admission process as established by C of O for transfer students.</p>
<p><em>The Ozarks Technical Community College system offers associate degrees and certificates in a variety of technical, allied health, and two-year transfer degree programs, as well as workforce development opportunities and community enrichment courses. </em></p>
<p>OTC, which was named one of the fastest-growing community colleges in the nation earlier this year, reported a 13,907 student enrollment for the fall 2010 semester. &nbsp;Recently, the college announced its Board of Trustees approval for the purchase of land to develop a campus in Hollister.</p>
<p>College of the Ozarks is a four-year, Christian college where students work on-campus jobs and do not pay tuition.&nbsp; It offers bachelor&rsquo;s degrees in 44 majors.&nbsp; Based on the number of degrees awarded in the program, agriculture is one of C of O&rsquo;s top three majors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>C of O is consistently named one of the best colleges in the nation by<em> The Princeton Review</em>, <em>Kaplan/Newsweek</em>, <em>Forbes</em> magazine and many others.&nbsp; This fall, <em>U. S. News &amp; World Report </em>ranked C of O as the seventh best regional college in the Midwest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The C of O mission is <em>&ldquo;to provide the advantages of a quality, Christian education to youth of both sexes, especially those found worthy, but who are without sufficient means to procure such training.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>For more information on the C of O/OTC articulation agreement, please contact Dr. Gavin O&rsquo;Connor at (417) 447-8241.</p>

		<title>OTC, Drury sign A+ program agreement</title>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>High school students throughout southwest Missouri now have an extra incentive to use the Missouri A+ program after an agreement was recently signed between Ozarks Technical Community College and Drury University.</p>
<p>&nbsp;OTC A+ students who meet certain academic criteria will be able to dual enroll at both the College and Drury and then transfer seamlessly to the four-year university after attaining their associate of arts degree at OTC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;They also could qualify for a $5,000 scholarship that will be available only to A+ students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Qualifying students that began at OTC in the fall of 2009, as freshmen, are eligible for the program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;All Springfield schools along with a long list of local school districts are designated A+ schools including Nixa, Ozark, Republic, Lebanon, Branson, Bolivar and Waynesville can participate in the new program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;This partnership provides an excellent opportunity for our A+ students to continue their education at Drury. Those students who benefit from the A+ program in their first two years will now be eligible for scholarships that were not previously available, said Dr. Hal Higdon, president of OTC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;We see students 13,000 strong come to OTC this fall and they are bright, committed, well-educated students that will do well at OTC. They'll do well at Drury, and they'll come back into this community and they'll make this a better place to live for all of us.&rdquo;<br /> <br /> Drury President Todd Parnell added, &ldquo;We want to make it as easy as possible for students to get a quality first-class, four-year education and we're working together to try and provide that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To be qualified for early admission at Drury, the A+ students must be admissible to Drury, maintain at least a 3.25 grade point average each semester at OTC and graduate from OTC with an associate&rsquo;s degree.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The A+ Program, more than 15 years old, is a one-of-a-kind program that has opened the doors of Missouri&rsquo;s community colleges to thousands of eligible high-school students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;It provides tuition to any Missouri public community college or career/technical school to high school students that meet the following requirements:</p>
<p>&bull; Graduate from high school with an overall GPA of 2.5 or higher on a 4-point scale.</p>
<div>&bull; Have an overall attendance rate of at least 95 percent for grades 9-12.</div>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>&bull; Perform 50 hours of district-supervised, unpaid tutoring or mentoring.</p>
<p>&bull; Enter into a written agreement with the high school prior to graduation.</p>
<p>&bull; Attend an A+ designated school for three years immediately prior to graduation.</p>
<p>&bull; Maintain a record of good citizenship and avoid the use of drugs and alcohol</p>
<p>When the program began at Ozarks Technical Community College, there were just 70 A+ students.&nbsp; This year, there are more than 1,800 students participating.</p>
<p>In all, more than 15,000 students have used A+ funds to attend OTC and earn an associate&rsquo;s degree, complete workforce training or advance to a four-year institution.</p>
<p>The program has helped OTC establish itself in the community as an educational choice that wasn&rsquo;t here 19 years ago.</p>
<p>Initially, the A+ program was designed to help reduce the high-school dropout rate and assist the state&rsquo;s businesses and industries fill their ranks with well-educated, well-trained workers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;But the program has gone on to spur many more high-school students to work hard to meet the requirements to qualify for the A+ program and experience a community college education.</p>
<p>&nbsp;For more information about the program, call OTC at (417) 447-7500.</p>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Ozarks Technical Community College and Springfield Remanufacturing Co. are working together to give SRC&rsquo;s personnel the opportunity to improve their education.</p>
<p>OTC has been conducting classes for about 20 students at the SRC site for several semesters as employees work towards an associate&rsquo;s degree in manufacturing.</p>
<p>Travis Morrison, Human Resources Manager for SRC Heavy Duty, said there were three barriers the company wanted to break down in offering the courses on site.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, we wanted to remove the cash crunch. &nbsp;Even though SRC has paid 100 percent tuition reimbursement for many years, we realized that personally funding even one class for a semester is difficult for some people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Second,&nbsp; we wanted to create an inviting environment for the non-traditional student. Third, we wanted to eliminate the inconvenience of traveling to campus and hoping for a parking spot. &nbsp;Attending a familiar classroom setting with familiar faces allows our students to quickly dig into topics without having to re-introduce themselves to each class,&rdquo; Morrison said.</p>
<p>Shirley Lawler, associate vice president for academic affairs, said the pilot program with SRC has been customized to fit SRC personnel&rsquo;s needs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since it&rsquo;s being held on site, we can start classes whenever it&rsquo;s most convenience for the students. They are used to working in a manufacturing environment so long breaks aren&rsquo;t needed,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>OTC gains by taking the courses to the company&rsquo;s site, Lawler said, because the SRC students aren&rsquo;t using parking spaces in the lots or seats in classrooms on campus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a win-win for SCR and OTC,&rdquo; Lawler said.</p>
<p>OTC will work with other businesses to configure similar programs. For more information call 417-447-8102.</p>

                    <p>As someone who has been in business in Springfield for more than 60 years, Bill Foster has seen a lot of changes in his hometown. And one addition to the city and region that he points to with delight is that of Ozarks Technical Community College.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a special asset to Springfield and all of southwest Missouri. It helps people and that&rsquo;s why I like it,&rdquo; Mr. Foster said.</p>
<p>A native Springfieldian, Mr. Foster has turned his pride in OTC into a financial gift to the College. As a result of his generosity, the Bill R. Foster Student Services has been named after the businessman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very nice to see. I am humbled by it. It&rsquo;s an opportunity to give that I welcome. I think it&rsquo;s important to let students see that someone cares about them,&rdquo; Mr. Foster said.</p>
<p>The businesses that Mr. Foster started have all focused on one premise &mdash; helping people.</p>
<p>From designing assisted-living homes to building hotels, the Foster Hospitality Group always has been about lending a hand to people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been helping people one way or the other, no matter what their age, for 61 years,&rdquo; Mr. Foster said.</p>
<p>Mr. Foster said OTC plays an important role in the region&rsquo;s economic and business landscape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OTC allows a business to draw from students who are educated and ready to go to work. That&rsquo;s a wonderful source to have,&rdquo; Mr. Foster said.</p>
<p>And yet, it&rsquo;s helping the students that Mr. Foster puts at the top of his priority list and the reason why he gave his donation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OTC enables people to further their education and elevate their standard of living. I love seeing that. It&rsquo;s a wonderful thing. It&rsquo;s a wonderful place,&rdquo; he said.</p>

                    <p>By Steve Koehler</p>
<p>OTC&rsquo;s Center for Workforce Development and the Southwest Area Manufacturing Association (SAMA) are teaming up to produce better-trained, homegrown manufacturing workers.</p>
<p>The consortium is in the early stages and would work to share training ideas and resources among its members.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The primary goal is to basically discuss and address a variety of gaps and needs in common skills and help reduce the leaks in the job-training pipeline,&rdquo; said Dawn Busick, executive director of OTC&rsquo;s Center for Workforce Development.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The training would help strengthen the output of skilled and competent workers for this region&rsquo;s manufacturing businesses.&rdquo; Rita Needham, executive director of SAMA, said local manufacturers are being surveyed to see what their needs are in terms of training a skilled workforce.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boomers are retiring and we need people in place in the pipeline to replace those leaving. Manufacturing is automating a lot. We need to determine what types of skills are needed to handle the new technology,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The group plans to examine the creation of programs that would allow unemployed individuals access to training that would provide an&nbsp;entry-point into manufacturing jobs.</p>
<p>The strategy group would be instrumental in deciding what skills should be included in training for areas such as industrial maintenance and&nbsp;general machine operations.</p>
<p>Companies could hire from this trained workforce pool and know what kinds of skills have already been developed.&nbsp;It is possible that grant money might be available for a consortium-based training program.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This collaborative effort will serve as a key factor in helping create a solution for homegrown manufacturing talent,&rdquo; Busick said.</p>
<p>The group approach could help manufacturers with budget issues.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This group can help reduce the cost of training. If a dozen companies need the same training, it can help cut costs by offering to all at the same time,&rdquo; Needham said.</p>
<p>Reggie Hoskins, CWD&rsquo;s workforce specialist business manager, said the consortium could also explore hiring practices and sharing best practices in place at the various firms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we pool our resources, we can offer training at reasonable costs. Without the group, training might not be available,&rdquo; Hoskins said.</p>

		<title>OTC's dental hybrid program prepared for online</title>

                    <p>Ozarks Technical Community College&rsquo;s dental assisting hybrid program is ready to roll out and offer a new learning avenue for the non-traditional student looking for a new career.</p>
<p>The blended program was made possible by the state of Missouri&rsquo;s Training for Tomorrow grant, which was designed to get people back to work and give workers new skills they need for better employment.</p>
<p>Scheduled to begin in the January 2012 spring semester, the program will offer all traditional lecture courses online and on campus hands-on skills training as the students work their way toward a dental assisting certificate or an Associate of Applied Science degree in Dental Assisting. In addition, the required 300 hours of clinical experience is obtained under the guidance of area dentists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hope to attract potential students who want to be a dental assistant but feel they cannot attend a traditional classroom setting due to family responsibilities and/or being employed. This is also an opportunity for those who are already in the dental field but haven&rsquo;t had any formal dental education to achieve their certificate,&rdquo; said Ida Guynn, OTC&rsquo;s dental programs instructor who developed the online program.</p>
<p>The hybrid program is designed in eight-week blocks within three semesters. The instruction will involve online course activities, and the students are required to come to campus during the eight-week block sessions to complete hands-on skills training.</p>
<p>Tamela Massey, office administrator for Dr. Jerry Cash and a member of OTC&rsquo;s Dental Advisory Board, said there are two big benefits for offering the hybrid program.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obviously, there is turnover and this is a way of getting more people into the community to fill those jobs,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Plus, it will give people who are working an opportunity to have a career and allow them to work and get an education at the same time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Applications are being accepted through Oct. 15. For more information, go to http://www.otc.edu/alliedhealth/13457.php or call the Allied Health office at (417) 447-8954.</p>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Summer vacation is fast approaching and if you&rsquo;re a parent, you probably need something to occupy your child&rsquo;s time during the coming months.</p>
<p>Ozarks Technical Community College&rsquo;s Continuing Education Center offers some unique and innovative programs to keep your child&rsquo;s mind, body and hands busy.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Kids College, now in its fifth year, offers programs on everything from learning about robots and rocket science to being a crime scene investigator. There&rsquo;s even an Etiquette Academy Finishing School for children to learn the proper ways to meet, greet and introduce people and proper dinner etiquette.</p>
<p>Dana Thorp<strong> </strong>Patterson, the center&rsquo;s director, said the programs are designed to introduce kids to a variety of topics and to engage them in new skills and activities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OTC has a wonderful concept of opening the college doors to everyone, including kids. &nbsp;While we provide classes, camps and programs throughout the year, we offer an even richer selection during the summer. We provide amazing classes and projects for these kids and we see a lot of return students &ndash; watching them grow up right here on campus is awesome,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>This summer, the program has added an Eco-Friendly Kids Camp where kids will learn about recycling and reusing products - all of their projects will be made out of recyclable materials.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our goal continues to be a provider of enriched and enjoyable lifelong learning for all of our community members, including the younger ones,&rdquo; Patterson said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Classes range in length from one to five days and are offered to children ages three and up. Fees for the classes vary. Most are held on OTC&rsquo;s Springfield campus and some programs include lunch. Almost every interest and hobby is offered at this year&rsquo;s college.</p>
<p>To view the summer schedule, log onto www.otc.edu/continuinged or call us at 447-8888 to have a catalog mailed to you.</p>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>Ozark Technical Community College&rsquo;s Lebanon Education Center has been a fixture in Laclede County for a dozen years and continues to draw more students with each passing semester.</p>
<p>Located in the Nelson Education Center, 533 W. Bland, OTC offers students a chance to earn an Associates of Arts degree, an Associate of Applied Science degree or work towards fulfilling requirements for a four-year degree.</p>
<p>Courses are offered both day and night to allow for a student&rsquo;s busy schedule. Class topics range from life sciences and public speaking to economics and world history.</p>
<p>In addition, residents can take continuing education courses that will enlighten and educate them. There are courses available in business and leadership, computer training, foreign language and personal growth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel that Lebanon is very lucky to have the Nelson Education Center, including OTC, and the opportunities that they provide our area. Not only the traditional students, but many adults, are able to further their education right here in Lebanon,&rdquo; said Debbie Wikowsky, executive director of the Lebanon Area Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>The Lebanon center is especially convenient for Lebanon High School graduates who don&rsquo;t want to spend valuable gas money traveling to Springfield two or three times a week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going very well in Lebanon,&rdquo; said Sue Moore, OTC&rsquo;s Dean of Extended Campus and College Outreach. &ldquo;Enrollment continues to increase every year. We&rsquo;re adding full-time faculty. That makes a difference. The faculty cares about the students.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since Lebanon High School is an approved A+ campus, qualified students are eligible for tuition and fee reimbursements when they attend OTC at the Lebanon Center.</p>
<p>They also receive 50 percent of their textbook costs through the program. The program applies to those taking classes at the Lebanon center.</p>
<p>Information on the A+ program is available through the high school.</p>
<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>In addition to offering general education courses, the Lebanon center is the only OTC education center that also offers technical programs including manufacturing technology, networking and machine shop, all of which are very popular, Moore said.</p>
<p>John Greer is the coordinator of the Lebanon Education Center. He can be reached at 447-8931 or 447-8932. The center&rsquo;s main number is 532-5044 and the email address is lebanon@otc.edu.</p>
<p><em>Steve Koehler is coordinator of publications at OTC.</em></p>

		<title>OTC's new literary magazine to feature students, staff</title>

                    <p>By Steve Koehler</p>
<p>Ozarks Technical Community College&rsquo;s students and staff will soon have a new outlet to showcase their creative writing skills.</p>
<p>The college&rsquo;s first literary magazine, Launch, will be published both in print and online with stories, poetry and other forms of art submitted by students, faculty, staff and some invited creative artists from outside the college.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The English department has been wanting to begin a literary magazine for several semesters. &nbsp;Karen Foresee had the background and experience with another magazine so she took the lead on the project and really helped make it happen,&rdquo; said Richard Turner, chair of the English department.</p>
<p>Foresee, who teaches writing part-time at OTC, said there are a large number of community colleges that publish literary magazines and she was glad to see OTC add its name to the list.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The magazine is in the beginning process. It&rsquo;s not just focusing on short works but poetry and artwork, too,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It puts the college in a recognized group of community colleges that offer creative arts in addition to the academic studies. For students, it gives them a chance to go beyond just getting a grade. It means they&rsquo;re going to see something they&rsquo;ve done be published.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Submissions to the magazine can be made through March 12 but that deadline maybe extended, Foresee said. Submissions can be sent to launch@otc.edu. Publication is set for May.</p>
<p>Turner, Foresee and Mike Pulley, another English instructor, will select the items to be published.</p>
<p>The magazine will be printed on campus, Foresee said, with other funding coming from donations.</p>
<p>Turner said he is excited at the prospect of bringing a literary magazine to the college and show the work of staff and students alike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s excellent writing being done by OTC students and they deserve a venue to showcase their work. &nbsp;This is something we feel will grow and grow each year,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p><em>Steve Koehler is coordinator of publications at Ozarks Technical Community College. Contact him at</em> koehlers@otc.edu.</p>

		<title>OTC's next Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs prepares for new role</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
                    
                    <p>There are paintings of tall mast ships hanging on several walls in Steven Bishop&rsquo;s office, a symbol of the OTC administrator&rsquo;s new role.</p>
<p>Later this month, Bishop will take the helm of OTC&rsquo;s academic ship as the fourth vice chancellor of academic affairs in the college&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>Bishop is replacing Shirley Lawler, who is retiring at the end of June, and also is turning the page to a new chapter in his career that began when he came to the college more than 20 years ago as an adjunct faculty member.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was in healthcare. I had no thought of going into education but OTC lost both healthcare instructors at the same time so I agreed to help out,&rdquo; Bishop said.</p>
<p>In 2002, Bishop became dean of the allied health department and up until then continued to work weekends in hospitals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was kind of hard to give up the medical career completely,&rdquo; said Bishop, who also has been serving recently as interim dean of general education.</p>
<p>Bishop knows he is responsible for leading the college on a very important mission in the coming years and said he is ready to face the challenges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Completion rates are a national issue. A lot of students come in unprepared for college work but to fix that we can&rsquo;t have a one-size-fits-all, cookie cutter approach. We have to tailor the approach for it to be effective for everyone,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>If successful, Bishop said, the results &ldquo;can have a positive effect on the community and other institutions in town because we are serving a niche that wasn&rsquo;t being served before we got here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bishop, 55, acknowledges that he is following some legendary academic leaders when he takes over. Having rubbed elbows with all of them has given Bishop some valuable insight.</p>
<p>Don Simmons, the first head of academics, taught Bishop the role of technical education and how it was just as important as general education.</p>
<p>Randy Humphrey, according to Bishop, stressed the importance of dealing with the details, while Lawler used her communication skills to show how much she cared for everyone she came in touch with.</p>
<p>Still, Bishop has his own leadership philosophy and he plans to use it when he takes over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I strongly believe in trusting those people to do what they do best. I want to give people the assistance they need to go do their job. Give them support and the tools they need to do a good job and you won&rsquo;t be disappointed with the results,&rdquo; Bishop said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Danna Lunday has three passions in life: her family, OTC&rsquo;s Students in Free Enterprise and collecting food for the hungry.</p>
<p>Lunday, SIFE&rsquo;s vice president, is so passionate about the organization and the food drive that she couldn&rsquo;t wait to get out of a hospital bed last year, when she was treated for a medical issue, and head up this year&rsquo;s SIFE food drive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While I was in the hospital, I saw a television report about the need for food in the area. When I was in SIFE two years ago, I volunteered for the food drive. This year, I wanted to do more,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The drive, entitled &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s Can Hunger Challenge,&rdquo; has begun and continues through Oct. 18 at the Springfield and Richwood Valley campuses. The OTC Branson Center chapter of SIFE takes over after that and continues the campaign through Oct. 31.</p>
<p>Lunday, who is studying business and hopes to transfer to a four-year university in May, is so committed to the drive that she even has convinced some of the doctors who treated her to allow their offices to be collection points for their patients who want to donate food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can have an impact,&rdquo; said Lunday, mother of five from Fair Grove. &ldquo;We have 15,000 students at OTC. If everyone brings one can of food, we can do a lot of good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s goal is to collect 15,212 pounds of food between the OTC Springfield and Richwood Valley campuses. That&rsquo;s equal to one pound of food per person enrolled at OTC.</p>
<p>Donations will go to the Christian County Family Crisis Center, the Least of These Food Pantry and the Ozarks Food Harvest.</p>
<p>Last year, SIFE collected more than 21,000 pounds, enough to feed 16,150 people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With today&rsquo;s economy and with what happened in Joplin, there is a real need for this type of food drive,&rdquo; Lunday said.</p>
<p>The public can contribute to the drive by bringing food to room 114 in Graff Hall on the Springfield campus or to the Student Services area at the Richwood Valley campus. More information is available at 447-8981 or by emailing sife@otc.edu.</p>
<p>Food can be brought to the Branson campus starting Oct. 17. From Oct. 28-30, food can be brought to the Country Marts in Hollister and Forsyth, the Harter House in Hollister and the two Wal-Mart Supercenters in Branson and Branson West.</p>

		<title>Paul Sundy to receive Excellence in Business Award</title>

                    <P align=justify>A humble Paul Sundy will accept the 2013 OTC Excellence in Business Award when its presented to him next month.</P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify>"Obviously, there are a couple of folks who have received it who are in a category that I have aspired to be like. Its very humbling. I dont feel like Im there or even close to their status," Sundy said.</P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P>The ceremony, which will include a conversation with Sundy conducted by Springfield Area Chamber of Commerce president Jim Anderson, will be April 12 starting at 7:30 a.m. at the White River Conference Center, 600 W. Sunshine St. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Other recipients to receive the annual honor have included John Q. Hammons, members of the OReilly family, SRCs Jack Stack, Great Southerns Bill Turner, real estate icon Carol Jones, business owner and attorney Sam Hamra and Jack and Peter Herschend of Herschend Family Entertainment.</P>
<P></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P></P>
<P align=justify>Sundy started his entrepreneurial career in 2003 in downtown Springfield and has opened and operated 16 different eating/drinking establishments over the last 10 years, including Big Whiskey's American Bar &amp; Grill, Parlor 88 Lounge &amp; Eatery, Opus Cigar Bar, and Dublins Pass Irish Pub &amp; Restaurant. </P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify>In addition, Sundy brought the Whole Hog BBQ and Einstein Bros. Bagels franchises to Springfield and opened locations in Little Rock and Chicago. </P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify>While hes had plenty of business successes, Sundy said he has had his share of failures, too. </P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify>"I think you learn more from the failures than the successes," he said.</P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify>Sundy is a member of the OTC Foundation Board of Directors and received the Distinguished Alumni Award from Ozarks Technical Community College in 2010.</P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P></P>
<P align=justify>Sundy credits Ozarks Technical Community College with sending him on his way to professional and personal success. </P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify>"When I attended OTC, I really started to fall in love with the Springfield area," said Sundy, a graduate of Marionville High School who earned his Associate of Arts degree from OTC in 2001.</P>
<P></P>
<P>"My business philosophy is you have to be willing to take yourself out of your comfort zone, and when people smarter than you talk, listen," he said. &nbsp;"You dont have to be the best at what you do. You just have to be willing to work harder than the other guy. Do what someone else has done, only better."</P>
<P></P>
<P>Tickets are $25. Visit <A href="http://www.otc.edu/excellenceinbusiness"><SPAN lang=EN>www.otc.edu/excellenceinbusiness</SPAN></A><SPAN lang=EN> </SPAN>or call (417) 447-2651 to reserve your seat.</P>

                    <p>Wading through the sea of paperwork and rules related to getting money to go to college can be a daunting task.</p>
<p>Ozarks Technical Community College is working to make that process easier, by increasing its effort to get basic information to students, family members and the public with a new series of financial aid sessions scheduled for the weeks ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Getting this information to students earlier, rather than later, will help in students&rsquo; overall experience in the financial aid process,&rdquo; said Joan Barrett, Dean of Students and Registrar.</p>
<p>The meetings, part of a series entitled &ldquo;Paying for College,&rdquo; will be held on the Springfield campus. The sessions will provide students with more information on what&rsquo;s exactly needed from start to finish in the financial aid process.</p>
<p>One session is set for Feb. 23 at 5 p.m. and another will be Feb. 25 at 9:30 a.m. The half-hour long sessions will be in Information Commons West Room 219. Reservations are not required.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a long time, we&rsquo;ve been aware that students have basic questions about starting the process. We try to do it one-on-one but it becomes difficult with the growing enrollment we&rsquo;ve been experiencing,&rdquo; Barrett said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These will be very broad informational sessions. They will not be individualized sessions.&rdquo; Barrett said, adding that important dates will financial process will be discussed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until someone tells you to apply early, you wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily think of it,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Barrett said her office urges students wanting to attend classes in the fall to apply early and no later than July 1.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The financial aspects of going to college can be intimidating. There is so much riding on it. If you don&rsquo;t submit your application and any required paperwork on time, it could impact your ability to attend college. That can make someone very anxious. You can apply anytime after the first of the year. But, the later you apply, it&rsquo;s likely you&rsquo;ll receive your money later,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Additional sessions are planned that will cover other aspects of college finances. For more information, call 417-447-6900.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Jennifer Myers flashed a smile as she walked across the stage of the Gillioz Theater Wednesday to receive her registered nurse&rsquo;s pin from Ozarks Technical Community College.</p>
<p>The Phillipsburg resident was proud to be one of 24 members of the College&rsquo;s first Associate of Science in Nursing class to receive RN status and excited about her future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means the opportunity to get a better job. I wanted to be an RN and that&rsquo;s why I came back to the program,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Myers said the OTC program was more affordable and blended better with her schedule.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was easier for me because I had an opportunity to get a part-time job and the faculty was very easy to work with,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The ASN program is designed as a Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN) to Registered Nurse (RN) program that permits the qualifying LPN to complete the RN nursing courses in 36 weeks.</p>
<p>The class received their pins in front of a crowd of more than 200 family and friends.</p>
<p>Dr. Hal Higdon, president of OTC, said it was a historic moment for OTC and the graduates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tonight, we took 24 people and doubled their earning potential from what it was yesterday. Think of what that means to a family. It will change the standard of living for their family,&rdquo; Higdon said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the life of the college this is a major step that we now have an RN program. It&rsquo;s a small program now but it&rsquo;s going to grow and as it grows, it can only help the community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sherry Taylor, the program&rsquo;s director, said she was excited to see the first class graduate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very proud of them. They are an exceptional group of students,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Tabitha Caye Burton, one of the graduates who spoke at the service, said: &ldquo;The journey has been an experience we will never forget.&rdquo;Taylor said that the class size will expand to 30 in the fall because of the high demand for the classes. She said the program is helping fill a need for skilled nurses in the region.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a good, strong allied healthcare program. This is helping with the nursing shortage,&rdquo; she said.</p>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>Springfield businessman Doug Pitt and the Jolie-Pitt Foundation are partnering with Ozarks Technical Community College to bring the &ldquo;Care to Learn&rdquo; program to campus.</p>
<p>OTC is the first college to be a part of the program that will offer emergency financial help and other assistance to students or their dependents with hunger, health or hygiene needs.</p>
<p>Doug Pitt is the founder of the Care to Learn program and the foundation is headed by Pitt&rsquo;s brother, Brad and his wife, Angelina Jolie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are excited to partner with Doug Pitt and the Care to Learn program,&rdquo; said Dr. Hal Higdon, president of OTC.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doug&rsquo;s leadership in providing a better life and education to the young people of our area is a great example of servant leadership and I hope everyone is inspired to support this most worthy program. In these tough economic times, people turn to the community college and many of those people are in tough financial situations and this program is there to help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The OTC program, similar to those in place in the Springfield, Nixa and Ozark school districts, will provide immediate funding and action to meet any emergent health, hunger or hygiene issue a student or student&rsquo;s dependent might have. The program will soon expand to the Bolivar school district.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about addressing a physical need, restoring respect, and getting that child back in the classroom. A kid comes to school with a need and they are taken care of ASAP; restoring self worth and getting them back in the classroom,&rdquo; Pitt said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a great partnership with OTC. We want to bring the sunshine. These are $50 and $100 fixes. This is a way to right the ship. We don&rsquo;t want to turn people away. It&rsquo;s the OTC family we want to help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pitt came up with the idea for Care to Learn after hearing local poverty statistics.</p>
<p>Doug called his brother, Brad Pitt, and shared the stories and statistics with him. The idea was to come up with a fund that could take care of the students&rsquo; needs as soon as they are known.</p>
<p>On that same phone call, Brad said to do it and the Jolie-Pitt Foundation offered $50,000 to start the fund, a commitment for the first three years of the fund. Local businessman Jim D. Morris matched the Jolie-Pitt Foundation&rsquo;s pledge.</p>
<p>Todd Yerby, a communications faculty member at OTC, endorsed the program and told the audience Thursday that he has been in contact with students who could have benefited from the Care to Learn fund.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Addressing the issues of health, hunger and hygiene within the OTC community is a needed investment. It is an investment in education, well being and respect that will reap rich rewards well into the future,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every day, myself, along with my colleagues, watch students pass through our classrooms, our offices, these hallways, many of whom have significant needs related to health, hunger and hygiene.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yerby told audience about one such needy student he did not identify.</p>
<p>Yerby learned that the student had lost hours at work, had his utilities cut off, had no money for gas and didn&rsquo;t know where his next meal was coming from.</p>
<p>After six weeks of going to class, he was gone and Yerby never saw him again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This type of situation happens over and over again. Care to Learn, through the efforts of Doug Pitt and many others, provides the opportunity to change fortunes, challenge adversity and confront the basic needs of health, hygiene, and hunger,&rdquo; Yerby said</p>

                    <!-- @font-face {   font-family: "Cambria"; }p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal { margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: "Times New Roman"; }a:link, span.MsoHyperlink { color: blue; text-decoration: underline; }a:visited, span.MsoHyperlinkFollowed { color: purple; text-decoration: underline; }div.Section1 { page: Section1; } -->
<p class="MsoNormal">The new year will be a busy one at Ozarks Technical Community College with a number of major construction projects taking place at several locations through 2011.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;We are working to meet the needs of our students and our team continues to be up to the task to make things happen,&rdquo; said Rob Rector, vice president for administrative services.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Work will continue on the new Lebanon Education Center where the college will move from its current location to the new facilities donated by Reuben and Mary Lou Casey of San Clemente, Calif. The new center is located at 22360 Highway MM, just south of Interstate 44.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In addition to the two buildings, the gift included more than 13 acres of land.&nbsp; The total property is valued at approximately $2.6 million and is the largest gift the college has ever received.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Casey Hall will be home to 13 new classrooms, several offices and a computer lab available to students and the public. The work is expected to be finished in time for the fall 2011 semester that begins in August.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">At the Springfield campus, work is expected to start in February on the addition of second floor to the Information Commons West building that will be home to 10 new classrooms and several offices. Each classroom will seat 22 students, according to Rector.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In addition to the second-floor work, the first floor beneath the new classrooms will be redesigned to house the fitness center, a bookstore stockroom, the STARS lab and a quiet study area for students.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">That project also is expected to be completed in time for fall classes in August.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">While those two projects are in the process of being completed, work on building a new education center in Hollister is expected to start in mid to late 2011 with a completion date goal of August 2013.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">All of the projects are being paid for from a $10 million bond issue approved by the Board of Trustees in June.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;This is what&rsquo;s great about the growth of OTC. It&rsquo;s not just in Springfield but OTC is also growing at all of its education center locations,&rdquo; Rector said.</p>

		<title>Production of 'Tartuffe' play presents challenges </title>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The faculty, students and alumni involved in Ozarks Technical Community College&rsquo;s spring production of &ldquo;Tartuffe&rdquo; are facing some daunting challenges with this year&rsquo;s play.</p>
<p>First, organizers want to prove that the success of last year&rsquo;s spring play &ldquo;Picasso at the Lapin Agile&rdquo; by Steve Martin wasn&rsquo;t a fluke and that they can avoid the so-called sophomore jinx.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a misconception that the freshman play is the most important play. The sophomore play is the most important play. We have something to prove,&rdquo; said Kenneth Wilson, a fine arts faculty member and also the production director and actor in this year&rsquo;s play.</p>
<p>Secondly, for the cast of &ldquo;Tartuffe,&rdquo; written in French by Moliere in the 1600s, the English translation demands the actors to memorize and speak lines that are written in rhyming couplets.</p>
<p>That can be quite an undertaking for the players who must recite each line exactly and also be aware of the other actors&rsquo; lines to allow the rhyming dialogue to flow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never done anything like this. It&rsquo;s difficult at first,&rdquo; said Matt Albers, who plays Tartuffe.</p>
<p>In the play, which runs March 13-15 at the Gillioz Theater, Tartuffe, is a con artist who passes himself off as a holy man and wins the good graces of wealthy man named Orgon. Tartuffe is welcomed into Orgon's home and offered his daughter in marriage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Meanwhile, Tartuffe secretly attempts to woo Orgon's wife. &nbsp;Everyone can see Tartuffe as the lying, hypocrite imposter he is - except for Orgon. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The question that hangs over the play is: Will Orgon's family be able to expose Tartuffe before he destroys the household?</p>
<p>For Jon Herbert, the play&rsquo;s director, his challenge is making a script that is very dense with words understandable for the audience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s not just words that are a challenge, but poetic imagery and odd phrasings. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s iambic pentameter, so every line is 10 syllables long, and it&rsquo;s written in rhyming couplets. &nbsp;Many of the actors have very long speeches which have to be filled with meaning and movement,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s very easy to memorize the lines in a habitual rhythm or melody, and this becomes a challenge to break. But I have some talented, playful, inventive cast members who are meeting the challenge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amy Dowell, who plays Elmire, Argon&rsquo;s wife and the object of Tartuffe&rsquo;s affections, doesn&rsquo;t feel intimidated by the play&rsquo;s script.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never done any classical works. Memorizing is easy. The rhyming is difficult. The audience can just sit back and relax and they&rsquo;ll understand it,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Dowell said having many of the same cast members from last year&rsquo;s play has made for a comfortable feeling while in the midst of preparing &ldquo;Tartuffe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a big family. It&rsquo;s comfortable and it&rsquo;s fun,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tartuffe&rdquo; will be performed March 13 and 14 at 7:30 p.m and March 15 at 2:30 p.m. All performances will be at the Gillioz Theater. Tickets are $10. For more information call 447-4831.</p>

                    <p>Todd Daniel, a psychology instructor at Ozarks Technical Community College, is putting some of the newest technological media advances to work for his students.</p>
<p>Daniel teaches Introduction to Psychology and has turned more than three dozen of his class lectures into a series of podcasts titled &ldquo;Great Ideas in Psychology.&rdquo; They are available for free through iTunes, the Apple-based media player.</p>
<p>His podcast work was recently noted in an article in the American Psychological Association&rsquo;s national magazine, The APA Monitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I lecture three times a week and I wondered about what&rsquo;s to become of my lectures when I&rsquo;m through. I created this podcast as a way of preserving my lectures and to allow students a place to hear the information again,&rdquo; said Daniel, a Springfield native who has taught at OTC for 10 years.</p>
<p>Daniel said that while the lectures are targeted for introductory class students, all psychology students can learn from the podcasts on topics that range from sleep, dreaming and hypnosis to Sigmund Freud theories.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The podcasts really helped me pass my test,&rdquo; said Jason Duncan, a second-year student studying to become an elementary teacher who took Daniel&rsquo;s introductory class.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;The podcasts contain about 85 percent of his lectures. They are a good supplement to the class. It helps reinforce what you learn. They are entertaining, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And students aren&rsquo;t the only ones listening to Daniel&rsquo;s work. The podcasts are being downloaded all over the U.S. and the world, including Australia and some European countries.</p>
<p>Daniel&rsquo;s Web site is <strong>http://tinyurl.com/2f647bt</strong><strong> </strong>or listeners can subscribe to the podcasts for free on iTunes by searching for &ldquo;Great Ideas in Psychology.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Daniel also has lectured at the Missouri Instructional Technology Conference and at OTC about podcasting in the classroom and using the technology to improve learning. He creates the podcasts in his home using audio mixing software and hardware. The lectures range anywhere from 20-40 minutes in length.</p>
<p>Duncan said the podcasts are a great learning tool for students.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because of the podcasts being available, people who take his class have no excuse for not passing,&rdquo; he said.</p>

                    <P>Ashley O'Neal will never be accused of wasting time.</P>
<P>The OTC student uses nearly every moment of every day either working multiple jobs, assisting in the support of an ailing father, going to school full time or being a major part of the leadership of the colleges honors society.</P>
<P>"My dad taught me to work hard. It will pay off," said O'Neal, who holds a 4.0 grade point average while taking 14 hours of classes.</P>
<P>And her dad, Eric O'Neal, is a big part of her focus as he battles stage four rectal cancer.</P>
<P>"I try not to think about (the disease) a lot. He has his good days and bad days but he has a great attitude," she said.</P>
<P>ONeal, vice president of promotions for PTK, plans to run for president of the chapter, but she's has not ambition about running for political office stops there.</P>
<P>She's seen all she needs to see about politics through the eyes of her grandfather &nbsp;former Springfield Mayor Jim O'Neal.</P>
<P>"I would never run for mayor after seeing what he went through," said O'Neal, who is majoring in business.</P>
<P>Besides caring for her dad and carrying a full load of classes, O'Neal works in the customer service department of a local restaurant and is a tutor in the Carol Jones Writing Center at OTC.</P>
<P>It's a full day for O'Neal, who keeps everything in order on her daily planner but confesses that, "I need a new one."</P>
<P>Steve and Jo Fritts, faculty advisors of the colleges PTK chapter, are impressed by O'Neal's work and study ethic.</P>
<P>"Ashley is truly an amazing young lady.&nbsp;She is an inspiration," Steve Fritts said.</P>
<P>Jo Fritts said O'Neal enjoys life.</P>
<P>"She always has a smile at the ready. She has this amazing ability of taking a negative situation and just through her ability to see the possibilities she can turn it into a positive one. Her leadership skills are wonderful and I know that she will be successful in life," Jo Fritts said.</P>
<P>While she is making As in her classes at OTC its the lessons ONeal is spending time learning now that she holds dearest.</P>
<P>"I learn everything from Dad. He taught me to treat people like a human being," O'Neal said. </P>

		<title>Public to play role in OTC accreditation </title>

                    <p>Many people might think the accreditation process that will occur soon at Ozarks Technical Community College is strictly an internal affair.</p>
<p>Far from it.</p>
<p>As OTC goes through regional accreditation with the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and School in February, a key component of the process will be input from community stakeholders who have a vested interest in what OTC offers them.</p>
<p>OTC Online College Director Witt Salley, who is co-coordinator of OTC&rsquo;s self-study process along with Katherine Perkins, dean of academic services, said it is important that the community care about OTC&rsquo;s accreditation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without accreditation, OTC and all the benefits we provide could not exist. Our students could not take advantage of federal financial aid, and there would be no guarantee that OTC classes would transfer to other accredited institutions,&rdquo; Salley said.</p>
<p>The comprehensive accreditation site visit will be Feb. 7-9, 2011, as the commission seeks to determine if OTC is meeting established quality education standards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accreditation is one way the College demonstrates, publicly, its commitment to quality and its willingness to be held externally accountable to those we serve,&rdquo; said Dr. Hal Higdon, president of Ozarks Technical Community College.</p>
<p>While the commission will spend time on campus talking to students, faculty, staff, administrators and the Board of Trustees, the commission also will be soliciting comments from the general public along with various community, business and education groups.</p>
<p>In November, area residents will be notified with details about how to get those comments to the commission.</p>
<p>Perkins said OTC officials won&rsquo;t see the comments until just before the commission&rsquo;s site visit and will have the opportunity to review them during the commission&rsquo;s visit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This process promotes transparency and accountability. People will be able to give positive comments or express their concerns,&rdquo; Perkins said.</p>

		<title>Publication ranks OTC second in region's economic impact</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
                    
                    <p>Ozarks Technical Community College has had an enormous economic impact on the metropolitan Springfield area, according to rankings recently released by the Springfield Business Journal.</p>
<p>The College was second only to the immense growth of the local health care industry in the newspaper&rsquo;s list of &ldquo;30 Points of Change,&rdquo; issued to mark the publication&rsquo;s 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This ranking underscores how important our mission is to these communities. We work hard to have an impact on the local economic climate through the programs we offer and by meeting the educational and training needs of our local business community,&rdquo; said Dr. Hal L. Higdon, president of Ozarks Technical Community College.</p>
<p>Eric Olson, the newspaper&rsquo;s editor, said the College &ldquo;has had a strong connection to area businesses from day one. OTC is led by successful businesspeople and, in turn, leads students to success in business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The school&rsquo;s impact has been widespread in training students and, more so of late, sending people directly into a targeted workforce through partnerships with employers. Our editorial team felt the impact of OTC on the business community was deep and direct,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Since the College opened in 1991, enrollment has grown exponentially to make OTC the third-largest community college in the state, with over 13,000 students. Its five locations span across southwest Missouri, with locations in Springfield, Branson, Lebanon, Ozark and Waynesville. Additionally, the College&rsquo;s center for workforce development works with businesses on offering specialized workforce training for employees.</p>
<p>A new $10 million expansion project will have a tremendous impact across the region, including developments in Hollister, Lebanon and Springfield.</p>
<p>The College is designating $5 million to locate a new facility in the Hollister school district after voters in the school district approved joining the OTC district.</p>
<p>In Lebanon, a gift of buildings and property valued at $2.6 million from Reuben and Mary Lou Casey of San Clemente, Calif., will allow the College to establish a full campus there. OTC has allocated $3 million to infill the buildings with computer labs, classrooms and technical education equipment.</p>
<p>The continued rapid growth of the Springfield campus has made it necessary to begin a new $2 million classroom expansion project.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our goal at OTC is to bring the same economic impact we have had in the Springfield area to the communities in and around the Richwood Valley campus (Ozark), Branson, Lebanon, Waynesville and Hollister,&rdquo; Higdon said.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
                    
                    <p>The issue of literacy in the Ozarks and what Ozarks Technical Community College, the Ozarks Literacy Council and RSVP are doing to improve it now and in the future will be the topic of an upcoming meeting.</p>
<p>Representatives from OTC, the Literacy Council and RSVP&rsquo;s Reading Buddy Program will discuss literacy in the Ozarks at a community awareness meeting July 21 at 7 p.m. at The Library Center, 4653 S. Campbell Ave.</p>
<p>The three organizations, which serve the needs of children through adults, will address how their organizations are working to improve the literacy skills of local residents and how the local business, faith and service communities can make an impact by volunteering to help with their offered programs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since there are implications for our community, we are asking businesses, churches, and organizations to come learn how they can help by volunteering through one of these organizations,&rdquo; said Ramona George, director of OTC&rsquo;s Adult Education and Literacy program.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a growing demand for the community to provide literacy services. We would like for local groups and businesses to become aware of how they can help as well as benefit from their experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>RSVP works with children who need reading practice at their school site while the Literacy Council works one-on-one with children and adults outside of school hours.</p>
<p>OTC works with students enrolled in the Adult Education and Literacy classes that stress math, reading and language arts as well as English as a Second Language.</p>
<p>All of the three organizations provide free training for prospective volunteers and emphasize that teachers are not the only people who can be literacy volunteers.</p>
<p>A small business owner can often explain why being able to perform various mathematical calculations is important; a bank teller can be a reading buddy and a bookkeeper can be a great conversation partner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are all committed to finding a great match for that person who volunteers,&rdquo; George said.</p>

                    <p>By Steve Koehler</p>
<p>Local information technology professionals met Thursday to discuss developing a regional IT consortium.</p>
<p>Sponsored by Ozarks Technical Community College&rsquo;s Center for Workforce Development and the Springfield Area Chamber of Commerce, the organizational meeting was designed to weigh the interest in starting an organization made up of IT professionals.</p>
<p>Dawn Busick, executive director of OTC&rsquo;s workforce center, said the consortium could help ensure that southwest Missouri attracts, retains and develops the innovative IT talent pipeline needed to support the region's emerging high-tech jobs.</p>
<p>Busick said she was pleased with the turnout of 30 local IT leaders and experts. The group will meet again in January, signaling the group is likely to be formed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to identify the skills IT employees needs. This isn&rsquo;t one problem. It&rsquo;s not just education. Companies are looking for specific credentials and skills,&rdquo; Busick said.</p>
<p>Some in the audience said there are IT jobs available in the region but a catalog of those jobs needs to be developed that applicants could see in on centralized place.</p>
<p>Austin Story, an IT graduate who works for Forex 5000 in Springfield, said there are lots of issues the group could address, especially in the area of education.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it was a good meeting. We need to get the community to address the disconnect between IT education and businesses. There has to be more opportunities developed. That would be great,&rdquo; Story said.</p>
<p>Busick said the group will help the southwest region maintain a competitive edge in today's global marketplace a number of ways, including:</p>
<p>&bull; Gaining a better understanding of the area's IT-talent needs to assist in making critical business decisions that affect global competitiveness.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>&bull; Sharing in private, federal and state funding resources available to regional-based collaborations such as the proposed IT consortium.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&bull; Sustaining a skilled regional IT talent pipeline.</p>
<p>For more information about the next meeting contact Busick at busickd@otc.edu or Sherry Coker at cokers@otc.edu.</p>

                    <p>By Steve Koehler</p>
<p>The registration for spring semester classes at Ozarks Technical Community College begins next week.</p>
<p>Joan Barrett, the college&rsquo;s registrar, said after this fall&rsquo;s enrollment jumped 16 percent to over 13,000 students, it&rsquo;s hard to predict how much of an increase there will be from last year&rsquo;s spring semester enrollment of 10,617.</p>
<p>Barrett expects more students to stay enrolled for the spring semester and also believes there will be increases in online class enrollment and in the number of students who&nbsp; attend OTC first before transferring to a four-year institution.</p>
<p>There are four dates to remember for those planning to take classes this spring, which begin Jan. 11.</p>
<p>&bull; Nov. 10 is the start of registration for those who have taken 30 credit hours or more at OTC.</p>
<p>&bull; Nov. 12 is the first day of registration for those students with 15-29 credit hours.</p>
<p>&bull; Nov. 16 for those with 14 credit hours or less.</p>
<p>&bull; Nov. 19 is the first day of registration for new students.</p>
<p><strong>New students need to do a few things before they come to campus to register:</strong></p>
<p>&bull; Have your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form completed and processed. It&rsquo;s available online at www.fafsa.ed.gov</p>
<p>&bull; Go to www.otc.edu and fill out the online application. You should get an acceptance letter in about a week.</p>
<p>&bull; Have your college, high school or GED transcripts sent to the OTC admission department.</p>
<p><strong>When you come to campus:</strong></p>
<p>&bull; Bring a photo ID. Payment is not required when you register.</p>
<p>&bull; If you haven&rsquo;t taken the ACT or if the test is more than two years old, you will have to take a COMPASS test free of charge to help place you in the correct general education courses.</p>
<p>&bull; Finally, you can sign up for classes, either in person or online.</p>
<p>For more information, go to our Web site at www.otc.edu</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Class registration for the upcoming spring semester begins next week at Ozarks Technical Community College, and predicting how much the enrollment will increase is difficult, especially when it jumped 16.6 percent last spring.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Certainly it is difficult to predict how much growth we might experience for the upcoming spring. We would be pleased to see most of the students enrolled this fall semester return for spring,&rdquo; said Joan Barrett, Associate Vice President for Student Affairs.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;Registration for students with 30 credit hours or more begins Nov. 9. Students with 15-29 hours can begin registering Nov. 11. Students with less than 15 hours can begin registering Nov. 15. New students can begin registering Nov. 18.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;As we&rsquo;ve seen in recent years, hard economic times often affect the enrollment of a community college the most as people turn to technical and career-development courses, as well as college transfer courses, to improve their chances of finding a job,&rdquo; Barrett said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>All new students are required to attend an advising session prior to registration.</span><span> </span><span>Call 417-447-6944 for a Student Advising and Registration</span><span> </span><span>(STAR) session for the Springfield campus. Students attending the Richwood Valley campus one of OTC&rsquo;s three education centers need to contact the location. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Current and returning students need to log onto My OTC to see their assigned advisor.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">New students should:</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span>&bull; Have their Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form completed and processed. It&rsquo;s available online at www.fafsa.ed.gov.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span>&bull; Go to www.otc.edu to fill out the online application. They should receive an acceptance letter in approximately a week&rsquo;s time.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span>&bull; Have their college, high school or GED transcripts sent to the OTC admission department.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">When they come to campus:</span></strong><strong></strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span>&nbsp;&bull; Bring a photo ID. Payment is not required when registering.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span>&nbsp;&bull; If you haven&rsquo;t taken the ACT or a test score is more than two years old, you will have to take a COMPASS test free of charge to help place you in the correct general education courses.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span>&nbsp;&bull; Students can sign up for classes, either in person or online.</span></p>

		<title>Registration starts next week for summer, fall classes</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
                    
                    <p>April is national Community College month and, by coincidence, the pace at Ozarks Technical Community College is about to pick up this month, too.</p>
<p>Registration will begin for summer and fall classes next week, so it&rsquo;s a time when current and prospective students will start gathering their paper work and their thoughts about selecting classes.</p>
<p>Registration dates are set according to the number of credit hours a student has amassed.</p>
<p>For those with 30 or more hours, registration starts Tuesday. For those with 15-29 hours, registration starts April 22. For those with 1-14 hours, signup starts April 26 and for those who have not taken classes at OTC, registration starts May 4.</p>
<p>Newcomers learn more about the registration process at a Student Advising and Registration (STAR) session. For more information on those sessions, call the main campus at 447-6944 or the Richwood Valley campus at 447-7727.</p>
<p>Joan Barrett, dean of students and registrar, said the registration is done in segments to offer students more assistance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easier for everyone. Students don&rsquo;t have to wait in super long lines. We can spend more time with the student,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>School officials are urging students to take advantage of the online registration process that&rsquo;s available through their MyOTC account. Newcomers receive access when they enroll. Last year, about 70 percent of all students registered online.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a much smoother process. It works so well,&rdquo; Barrett said.</p>
<p>Registration continues until June 9 for summer classes and until Aug. 25 for fall, but the sooner a student registers, the better the chance of getting a needed class.</p>
<p>But not registering on the first day isn&rsquo;t a problem either, Barrett said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t missed the bus if you&rsquo;re not registered on the first day. Students can come in and ask questions and get started. If they don&rsquo;t have access to a computer, they can come in and use one available here,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Just how many students will attend OTC in the fall? Barrett isn&rsquo;t predicting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last July 1, registration was down 2 percent over the year before and we ended up with a 17 percent increase,&rdquo; she said.</p>

		<title>Richwood Valley centerpiece of OTC open houses</title>

                    <p>By Steve Koehler</p>
<p>Sitting on Missouri 14 between Nixa and Ozark, the Richwood Valley campus of Ozarks Technical Community College is a stunning structure on the outside and, this month, residents and students are invited for a special look inside.</p>
<p>The Richwood Valley campus, along with OTC&rsquo;s three education centers, will conduct open houses for students and the public to come and get acquainted with their facilities.</p>
<p>The Richwood Valley open house is Thursday, July 29 from 3-6 p.m.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We offer students personalized service. We don&rsquo;t have the crush of students that there is at the main campus. It&rsquo;s less hectic from the parking lot to the classroom,&rdquo; said Steve Biermann, administrative dean at Richwood Valley, who added that south Springfield residents can get to the Richwood Valley campus faster than they can drive to the Springfield campus.</p>
<p>Since opening its doors in the spring of 2007, enrollment at Richwood Valley has grown from 478 to more than 1,000 students.&nbsp; While the focus has been primarily on general education courses, Richwood Valley also offers a number of Allied Health programs including Physical Therapy Assistant (PTA) and Medical Lab Technician.</p>
<p>With state-of-the-art classrooms, all equipped with the latest audio and video teaching tools, the environment is the perfect setting for the Allied Health programs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those teachers love this environment,&rdquo; Biermann said.</p>
<p>In addition, the faculty has access to the campus&rsquo; 90 acres of land, which they use as a laboratory for science classes. The creek that borders the campus is used for research, and the tree groves are used for practice in identifying various species.</p>
<p>A new FEMA-approved storm shelter is open on campus, too.&nbsp; Biermann said the shelter is being used to conduct some PTA courses and will soon be the home of a state-of-the-art driving simulator for truck driving students. It will also give law enforcement officers training in defensive driving skills.</p>
<p>The shelter was put to practical use when 20 residents, along with faculty, staff and students used the facility several weeks ago when a threatening storm approached the campus.</p>
<p>The other open houses are scheduled for:</p>
<p>&bull; Waynesville Education Center: July 27, 9 a.m. &ndash; noon.</p>
<p>&bull; Lebanon Education Center: July 27, 2-5 p.m.</p>
<p>&bull; Branson Education Center: July 28, 10 a.m. &ndash; 1 p.m.</p>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Enrollment at the Richwood Valley campus of Ozarks Technical Community Center continues to grow at a steady pace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The campus, now in its third full year, has seen a 28.6 percent increase in enrollment over last fall, with almost 1,100 student currently taking classes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;The large jump in enrollment can be attributed to several factors including convenience, the addition of two allied health programs, and the economy,&rdquo; said Stephen Biermann, administrative dean of the Richwood Valley campus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christian County is one of the fastest growing counties in the state of Missouri and many area students, including those living in southeast Springfield, have found Richwood Valley to be closer to home than the Springfield campus. &nbsp;Many students also find smaller class size, easy access to parking, and quick service in our Student Services area to be a big benefit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some additions and changes have helped attract more students to the Christian County campus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;New additions to the Richwood Valley course offerings include two allied health programs, Medical Lab Technician and Physical Therapy Assistant. &nbsp;Both of these courses of study are now available only at this location. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;A collaboration with Drury University also allows Business and Education majors the opportunity to earn a 4-year degree in either of these disciplines at the Richwood Valley campus.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The addition of a new walking trail and a nearly complete FEMA storm shelter also benefits our neighbors. &nbsp;Both of these features are designated for public use and benefit the surrounding community.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Richwood Valley serves as a prime example of how residents will respond positively if the education facility is located nearby.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;If residents can attend college locally, limit spending on transportation, and still have the time to work and care for their families, they are more likely to seek and accomplish their educational goals,&rdquo; said Dr. Sue Moore, OTC&rsquo;s dean of Extended Campuses and College Outreach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Overall, enrollment at OTC&rsquo;s two campuses and three education centers is up nearly 16 percent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;As we have continued to grow as an institution, our student population has also grown, and we are working hard to meet the needs of each student,&rdquo; said Dr. Hal Higdon, president of the College.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;However, with state funding continuing to diminish, there is little we can do to alleviate our physical capacity issues, particularly at the Springfield campus.&rdquo;</p>

		<title>Richwood Valley enrollment up 20 percent in spring</title>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>Enrollment this spring increased nearly 20 percent at Ozarks Technical Community College&rsquo;s Richwood Valley campus in Christian County.</p>
<p>This spring, there are 807 students enrolled, an increase of 19.6 percent over last year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Richwood Valley campus has once again witnessed significant growth this spring with more than 1,000 students enrolling for credit classes. &nbsp;An increase of almost 20 percent over the previous spring semester can be attributed to the growing popularity of OTC&rsquo;s newest campus. &nbsp;The addition of two Allied Health programs by fall of 2009 will also help the campus to grow in the near future,&rdquo; said Steve Biermann, administrative dean of the campus.</p>
<p>Classes have been held in the 60,000 square foot Life Science Technology Center since it opened in the spring of 2007.</p>
<p>Biermann said Christain County residents are beginning to see to vital educational role Richwood Valley plays in the area.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re meeting the educational needs of Christian County and the surrounding areas. &nbsp;The word is out that the Richwood Valley campus is convenient and a great place to attend classes, learn, and socialize. &nbsp;Students have been particularly impressed with the quality of instruction, excellent facilities, and great customer service they receive at Richwood Valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The 20 percent growth says we&rsquo;re filling a need and we will continue to fill the needs of Christian County residents,&rdquo; said Dr. Hal Higdon, president of OTC.</p>
<p>The Richwood Valley campus is in the process of expanding with federal money going towards the construction of a tornado shelter.</p>
<p>The $1.13 million grant from the Federal Emergency Management Office will cover 75 percent of the cost of the shelter. Local and state money will pay the remaining $375,000.</p>
<p>The shelter will be able to house more than 1,000 people living within five minutes of the campus in case of threatening weather.</p>
<p>Enrollment is up 37 percent over last spring at the College&rsquo;s three education centers at Branson, Lebanon and Waynesville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In these difficult economic times, it is even more important for higher education to be convenient, accessible, and affordable for all.&nbsp; The College strives to support the local economies of communities within the service region through high quality workforce, technical, and general education,&rdquo; said Dr. Sue Moore, dean of extended campuses and college outreach.</p>
<p>Overall, OTC&rsquo;s spring enrollment is up 6.9 percent overall from last spring with a total of 10,588 students taking classes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe that half of the increase is based on the hard times we are in and half is due to OTC continuing to meet the needs of people in our service area,&rdquo; said Dr. Hal Higdon, president of OTC.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> &ldquo;I think it shows that when the times are tough, they know that going to a community college is the best thing they can do to improve their lives. More education and training are going to help you.&rdquo;</p>

		<title>Richwood Valley has body part replicas in library</title>

                    <P>Students usually head to the library to find a required book or some other printed study materials.</P>
<P>At the OTC Richwood Valley Campus learning resource center, anatomy students can now get the materials they need for their studies &nbsp;body parts.</P>
<P>A number of body-part replicas are available for human anatomy classes offered at Richwood Valley and can be checked out from the center.</P>
<P>"We had a student come to us and asked if we had thought about having the items available," said Ethan Hart, director of Richwood Valley's LRC. "Until now, the material was kept in the science lab. It was't accessible all the time. In the library, it's available until 8 p.m."</P>
<P></P>
<P>Hart said it was a great idea to make the items available. The models include an arm, a leg, a heart, a brain, an eye and an ear.</P>
<P>"Being a small campus, sometimes you have to think outside the box in regards to providing service. I talked with a science instructor about the models and then started talking to some students about whether they would be interested in using the models in the library. From their input, several models were identified and ordered. It's definitely something you don't see every day in a library," he said.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The models, which stay in the library when students study them, are very realistic looking with moveable parts, many of which have been hand painted. Each part is numbered for identification purposes.</P>
<P>Christie Campbell, who teaches the anatomy classes, said students would begin studying the models later this semester.</P>
<P>"These are the items we will be talking about in our anatomy and physiology classes. The classes are growing in size and having the models in the library suits their needs," she said.</P>
<P>"It's more convenient for them. Sure, they could go online and look at a picture but it's not the same. It's not the same as holding them. It's not the same as looking at a picture."</P>
<P>Depending on interest, more models of more parts could be ordered.</P>
<P>"If there is a demand from students for more models, it's something we would definitely look into," Hart said.</P>

                    <p>Jacque Blauvelt knows she won&rsquo;t be a registered nurse all of her life. So, she&rsquo;s working on a second career; one that&rsquo;s fulfilling to her and entertaining for her young readers.</p>
<p>Blauvelt is the published author of the children&rsquo;s book: &ldquo;Bass Buddies A to Z.&rdquo; She wrote, illustrated and produced the book herself, thanks to training she received through courses she took through the Community Enrichment Center of Ozarks Technical Community College.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Publishing this book was on my bucket list,&rdquo; the Springfield resident said.</p>
<p>Blauvelt, who had studied art on her own, paired her talents with various computer software programs that taught her how to draw on a computer and design pages for publication. The classes allowed her to transform her ideas into book pages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The software is a marvelous medium to me. I applied what I learned on my own to those programs and developed the book,&rdquo; Blauvelt said, who is creating a similar book about numbers.</p>
<p>After three years of work, the book was recently published and is available through Amazon.com and the Big Cedar Lodge gift shop in Hollister.</p>
<p>The book is designed for readers from preschool to age 8 or 9, who either want to learn their letters or work on their reading.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s also a glossary to explain some of the terms and words used in the book.</p>
<p>Her cast of characters is a variety of made-up species of bass with distinctive names like Archie the Acrobass and Zinahbee Zoobass. Each appears with a limerick about the fish, which Blauvet said is in a Dr. Seuss format that young readers enjoy.</p>
<p><em>There once was a Seebass named Seamore</em></p>
<p><em>Who played Hide-and-Seek near the seashore.</em></p>
<p><em>But when he was &ldquo;it,&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>His friends had a fit</em></p>
<p><em>&lsquo;Cause Seamore the Seebass could see more!</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the whimsical world of bass buddies,&rdquo; Blauvet said.</p>
<p><em>Steve Koehler is coordinator of media services at Ozarks Technical Community College.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <!-- @font-face {   font-family: "Times"; }@font-face {   font-family: "Cambria"; }p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal { margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; font-size: 14pt; font-family: "Times New Roman"; }a:link, span.MsoHyperlink { color: blue; text-decoration: underline; }a:visited, span.MsoHyperlinkFollowed { color: purple; text-decoration: underline; }div.Section1 { page: Section1; } -->
<p class="MsoNormal">The Culinary Arts program continues to rank as one of the most popular offered at Ozarks Technical Community College.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And now, a Canadian television network will give viewers an inside peek into the talents of one of the program&rsquo;s alumni.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">William Peak, who attended the Culinary Arts program eight years ago, helped establish Savor Restaurant on Commercial Street in Springfield, will be featured on the TLC network&rsquo;s program &ldquo;The Opener&rdquo; later this year. It is airing in Canada now on the Food Network.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The episode, filmed last year in Springfield, followed Peak and his business partner, Erik Kincade, as they worked to get their restaurant off the ground.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;The show&rsquo;s producers were calling around the country and called the Springfield Area Chamber of Commerce who recommended us,&rdquo; Peak said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Filming took nearly a month to complete and Peak has yet to see the finished product.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">He fell in love with cooking as a child and came to the Culinary Arts program where he honed his talents.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;I really, really learned a lot. Culinary Arts taught me the basics about sauces and flavors. Everything has been a learning experience,&rdquo; said Peak, who grew up in Oldfield.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Peak came to OTC at the time when the program&rsquo;s new state-of-the-art kitchen facilities were brought on line.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;For somebody who didn&rsquo;t know how to fry in a fryer, it was very impressive,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: -0.5in;">Lisa Gardner, division chair of the Hospitality and Culinary Arts program, said in addition to the quality of the program, television has had an impact on enrollment.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: -0.5in;">&ldquo;There are a lot of cooking shows nowadays and the country in general has promoted the culinary arts,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Peak joins a growing list of those from OTC&rsquo;s Culinary Arts and baking programs who went on to success in the food industry.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Amy McGehee took baking classes through OTC&rsquo;s Community Enrichment program and established Amycakes, a popular bakery in downtown Springfield. Ric Ramos went from graduation last year to work for Iron Chef <span>Masaharu</span><span> </span>Morimoto in New York City and currently works at one of the city&rsquo;s top French restaurants.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: -0.5in;">Future chefs will be showcasing their talents starting next Thursday when the student-operated Scallions restaurant opens from 11 a.m. &ndash; 1 p.m. every Thursdays. For reservations, call 447-8283 or email scallions@otc.edu.</p>

                    <p>By Steve Koehler</p>
<p>The Culinary Arts and Hospitality Management programs at Ozarks Technical Community College continue to attract large numbers of students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;This year, more than 300 are enrolled in the programs, an increase of nearly 53 percent over last fall, making it one of the fastest growing and most popular programs the college offers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Students tend to choose areas where they see an opportunity for jobs. &nbsp;When you look at the fact that the hospitality industry is&nbsp;the second largest employment base throughout the United States, there is definitely stability for employment,&rdquo; Gardner said.</p>
<p>See the program in action, view a video that is posted at www.otc.edu.</p>
<p>But the students don&rsquo;t study in a vacuum. The public is invited to taste the students&rsquo; work at Scallions, the student-operated restaurant.</p>
<p>Everything from appetizers to entrees to desserts is prepared.</p>
<p>This semester, the restaurant is offering a &ldquo;Tour of America!&rdquo; with the menus changing weekly to showcase the country&rsquo;s different regional cuisines.</p>
<p>Some of them include the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Southern, Louisiana, Southwestern and Tex-Mex.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This year&rsquo;s concept is a very challenging one. &nbsp;Students are responsible for preparing different menus each week based on 12 regional cuisines from the United States&nbsp;If this rotational concept is a success it will become our on-going theme each semester,&rdquo; Gardner said.</p>
<p>Scallions opened in the spring of 2003 to give students real culinary and hospitality experience. The changing menu challenges students to learn new techniques while also providing quality food and service.</p>
<p>Students cook the food while other students serve as staff in the restaurant, taking ordering and serving the dishes.</p>
<p>The restaurant is open every Thursday during the semester from 11-1 with the last day of operation Dec. 3.</p>
<p>Reservations are preferred. Call 447-8283 or by emailing <a href="mailto:scallions@otc.edu">scallions@otc.edu</a>.</p>

                    <p>Meagen Fields is a perfect example of someone who was able to overcome short-term obstacles in order to reach her long-term goal, thanks to the help of an OTC Foundation scholarship.</p>
<p>After graduating from Nixa High School in 2007, Meagan&rsquo;s eyes were on the future. The first-generation college student had received an A+ scholarship and enrolled in OTC&rsquo;s Physical Therapy Assistant program.</p>
<p>But those plans hit a bump in the road when Meagen became pregnant in the middle of her sophomore year at OTC.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The idea of&nbsp;transferring was less appealing then,&rdquo; Meagen admitted. &ldquo;OTC had an accredited and well-known PTA program. This was awesome news for me because being a PTA was exactly the career I was looking for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After winning the OTC Foundation&rsquo;s Musgrave Foundation student scholarship, Meagen was able to breathe a little easier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a single mom, this scholarship was a great help. It mostly paid for my books each semester. Thanks to the scholarship I was able to have freedom from that burden and any little relief helps,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>She graduated Cum Laude in May 2009 with an Associate of Applied Science degree and again Cum Laude in May 2011 with an Associate of Applied Science &ndash; Physical Therapy Assistant.</p>
<p>Meagen is working at the North Arkansas Regional Medical Center in Harrison as a physical therapy assistant.</p>
<p>But she still has future education goals to reach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to find an area to specialize in and gain advanced&nbsp;recognition in that area; I am thinking maybe pediatrics but nothing is definite. I would also like to continue my education by gaining a&nbsp;Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in health services. Thanks to the start OTC and the Musgrave scholarship gave me, I&rsquo;m well on my way to reaching those goals,&rdquo; she said.</p>

                    <SPAN lang=EN>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Snow Popus has been overcoming obstacles her entire life. </P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>After leaving school in the third grade, she came to OTC to gain her GED. Now, Popus serves as president of the newly created OTC Science Club. She is on her way toward eventually earning a doctorate in teaching and a medical degree in osteopathic remedies while serving in the Air Force.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"My father didn't go to school but he insisted I read Shakespeare and learn science," Popus said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>She learned to love science, a field of study that is dominated by men, according to Jen Snyder, OTC chemistry instructor and department chair of the physical science department.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"The retention rate for college students studying in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (know as STEM) is low as well as things like the science club can help keep the interest up," Snyder said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"By 2020, there are going to be so many job in the STEM fields that we won't have enough prospects to fill the openings. About 40 percent are staying in the fields in college."</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>But Popus is determined to make it in medicine, thanks to some help from the Air Force, where she will soon enlist and study medicine on a military scholarship, followed by&nbsp; five years of active duty and three years of inactive. She will also work in a VA hospital for a period of time.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Popus has completed her transfer degree at OTC to Missouri State and is attending both institutions to complete a bachelors of science duel major in chemistry and cell and biomolecular biology.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Popus is glad the science club has gotten off the ground at OTC.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"First and foremost it provides students a chance to get involved in their school and community. Getting involved is essential in giving a person a feeling of ownership in their education and community," she said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Some of the clubs activities have included working with Big Brothers/Big Sisters to provide a day of scientific fun at OTC, a Science Olympiad for middle school students who will enjoy games and competitions based in science and science movie night.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"It gives students a chance to make friends of diverse backgrounds and teaches them to work together towards a common goal," Popus said. "Our goal is passing on our love of the sciences to others and helping others in the community."</P><I>

                    <P></P>
<P>Matt Duzan has two classrooms he works in as an instructor at the OTC Richwood Valley Campus. The first one is filled with traditional desks, chairs, lab equipment and wall cabinets. </P>
<P></P>
<P>The second has a bubbling creek running through it, a canopy of lush trees and blue skies serving as the ceiling, and a wide variety of birds, bugs and plants waiting to be examined.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Welcome to the study of environmental science, OTC style.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Duzan makes use of the natural settings around the Christian County campus to teach his students about the ecosystems that are right outside the campus doors.</P>
<P></P>
<P>"I try to liken the campus as my lab. Because of the nature of the course, I try and incorporate the various ecosystems found on the Richwood Valley campus. The students seem to enjoy it. I try to get them outside as much as possible," Duzan said.</P>
<P></P>
<P>One class can involve studying the water quality of the creek that feeds the nearby Finley River by collecting insects and crustaceans from the water.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Another session might focus on plant populations and soil types around the campus. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Field observations are conducted of birds that stay on campus. </P>
<P></P>
<P>The trail that encircles the campus is used as a path for students to travel in identifying the trees that are on campus.</P>
<P></P>
<P>"Getting out into the creek or the woods changes the dynamic of the class," Duzan said.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Students appreciate the chance to get out of the classroom to perform hands-on tasks as part of their studies.</P>
<P></P>
<P>"It helps me understand what's being said. I'm more of a hands-on person when it comes to remembering things," said Robby Johnson of Nixa.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Mike Fox, another Nixa student, said Duzan's approach helps keep the class exciting. </P>
<P></P>
<P>"Going outside helps reinforce the lectures by seeing it for real," he said.</P>
<P><I></P></I>

                    <p>By Steve Koehler</p>
<p>Their languages and locations may be far apart, but education leaders from Ozarks Technical Community College and Shanghai, China, have a very similar mission &mdash; educating their citizens.</p>
<p>A contingent of educators from Shanghai toured the Springfield and Branson campuses of OTC Thursday as part of a fact-finding mission the group was on to learn about the American education system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Shanghai community college system is very similar to OTC with students attending two or three years after high school graduation to earn a 2 year transfer degree or learn a technical trade, officials said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their target is to provide services to the area around it,&rdquo; said Tony Cheng, who attended a community college in Shanghai before coming the Branson to perform in the Shanghai Circus School.</p>
<p>The Chinese educators met with OTC President Hal Higdon and OTC board member J. Howard Fisk to discuss everything from what types of degrees OTC offers to the funding mechanism and sources that OTC receives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I was impressed with their curiosity and level of interest in the community college system. Like us, they feel the community college is the best route of Americans in gaining an education,&rdquo; Higdon said.</p>
<p>Similar to OTC, the Shanghai school system receives funds from the government but students also pay to attend school, similar to the way American students do.</p>
<p>More than 200,000 students attend community colleges in Shanghai, more than twice the number that attends all the public community colleges in Missouri. OTC&rsquo;s enrollment is more than 11,000. There are 140 two-and four-year colleges in Shanghai, a city of 17 million.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;We have a very deep appreciation for (OTC) and how it has served the area around here. The environment is very pretty,&rdquo; said Dai Xiaofu, the head of the delegation and deputy director of the Shanghai Municipal Education Committee, through an interpreter.</p>
<p>The delegation of about 10 toured OTC&rsquo;s technical and allied health centers, viewing the automotive and diesel repair shops along with the dental laboratories. They ate lunch at the student-operated restaurant Scallions where some of the visitors tasted Cajun food for the first time in their lives.</p>
<p>Later in the day, the group traveled to Branson to visit OTC&rsquo;s education center and to watch graduation at the Shanghai Circus School, held for the first time in the U.S.</p>
<p><em>Steve Koehler is coordinator of publications for OTC.</em></p>

                    <P>Phillip Nolan was known as the man without a country. OTCs Katherine Mantonya can be called with the student with two countries.</P>
<P>Mantonya will be leaving in a less than two weeks for Brazil, her second homeland, and where she lived for many years while her father worked as a second-generation missionary. He also grew up in Brazil.</P>
<P>"I was seven when we moved to Brazil where Dad planted churches and trained pastors," the 21-year-old said. "We stayed until 2003 and went back in 2004 and stayed for another eight years."</P>
<P>The family lived in the city of Porto Velho in the state of Rondonia near the equator. It's a city as large as Springfield but according to Mantonya "Springfield feels bigger."</P>
<P>In PortoVelho, homes were surrounded by 15-foot walls to keep thieves out because stealing was a big problem. </P>
<P>"Going out at night tended to be dangerous. We lived in the bad part of town and our house was robbed six times in eight months," she said. "But those living there were kind people, hospitable people. There are open markets and no one-stop shops."</P>
<P>Mantonya enjoyed growing up in the country where it was constantly hot and humid. A night when the temperature dropped to 75 degrees was a night when people "almost froze to death."</P>
<P>"It was always in the high 90s and the humidity was 80 percent. Last year, when it was so hot here, it felt really vice," she said.</P>
<P>The reason Mantonya is returning to meet the requirements of having a permanent visa to the country stamped, which her father got for her and her siblings when they first arrived in the South American country. </P>
<P>She will be gone for about a month and will then return to Springfield where she will resume her studies and working in OTCs Café 101 as a cashier.</P>
<P>And while she's lived in two countries, theres no question where her allegiance lies. </P>
<P>"Im an American. Three years ago, I was a Brazilian. But I like it here and I like it at OTC. I like my job and I want to come back to my job later this summer," she said.</P>

                    <p>Today is New Year&rsquo;s Day but at Ozarks Technical Community College, the new year begins Jan. 11 when spring semester classes start.</p>
<p>While a majority of the spring classes that OTC offers run the entire 16 weeks of the semester, the college also offers an ever-increasing number of shorter credit and technical courses that are six to eight weeks long for those seeking a certificate or retraining in a particular area or skill set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;These courses serve the region&rsquo;s unemployed, underemployed and unskilled workforce with quick and cost effective job training solutions in preparing them for job opportunities,&rdquo; said Dawn Busick, executive director of OTC&rsquo;s Center for Workforce Development.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some employers have told us they can&rsquo;t wait years or months for a skilled trained workforce. OTC&rsquo;s new workforce accelerated job training programs are in direct response to building a highly skilled workforce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few of those courses offered this spring are:</p>
<p>&bull; Home Energy Auditor: Training focuses on evaluating and improving the energy efficiency, comfort, indoor air quality, and durability of homes.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> &bull; Weatherization Technician: A week-long course for people who will be performing the actual weatherization work or who need to supervise those that do.</p>
<p>&bull; Commercial Drivers License: &nbsp;This five-week, 40 hours per week training program prepares participants for operating commercial trucks and successfully completing<br /> the CDL exam.</p>
<p>Registration continues at OTC. For more information on any of these programs or others, call 447-8901.</p>

                    <SPAN lang=EN>
<P dir=ltr align=left>By Stephen Arringdale</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Its a normal day for OTC student Amber Attaway. She carries the same hopes, desires and ambitions as her classmates to do well in her classes. </P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>There is one difference. Amber has been blind from birth and she is accompanied at the OTC Springfield campus with her service animal Macie, a quiet, black and white dog.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>They enter the room as a team and Macie walks straight to the desk she knows will be her spot for the next hour. Once there, Macie curls up beneath the desk and barely stirs. Amber opens her laptop and prepares for the lesson on Power Point. </P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Among the accommodations that allow Amber to read the computer presentation is a screen reader designed for the blind. It converts the text that sighted people read into spoken words. The device is available through OTCs Disability Support Services office where she is among about 1,000 students who receive assistance.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Amber is passionate about her beliefs in how people think of the disabled. </P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"Sometimes people ask me a lot of things but then they never talk to me again. That hurts, but not as much as being ignored," she said. "The main thing is to ask and get to know me."</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Her other passion is her companion and her best friend, Macie. Amber trained with Macie for four weeks in Michigan before they graduated as a team. She describes the training as one of her most fulfilling and challenging experiences in her life. </P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>It can be easy to miss the interaction between Amber and Macie but there is mutual communication. In some situations, Amber guides Macie. In other areas, Macie will come to a stop if she sees a danger that Amber does not. Macie is a well-trained service animal, but there is also a loyalty and bond between Macie and Amber that is impossible to miss. </P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>While service dogs are dedicated and serious, they also like to play. Macie has the energy and playfulness of a puppy, but she never forgets her job. Even while playing, Macie pauses every moment or so to look back at Amber to ensure all is well. </P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Ambers focus is on pursuing her psychology degree and she's happy to beat OTC,</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"I don't regret coming here at all and only wish the school ran a four year program," she said. </P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P><I>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Stephen Arringdale is a journalism student at Ozarks Technical Community College.</P></I></SPAN>

		<title>'Silent Witness' program coming to OTC</title>

                    <P></P>
<P>The issue of domestic violence will be the topic of a powerful display at OTC Springfield Campus today and Tuesday.</P>
<P>The Silent Witness Project comes to OTC in cooperation with the Community Partnership of the Ozarks and will have various life-sized wooden silhouettes, each accompanied by a brief narrative that tells the story of a real woman, man or child affected by family violence. </P>
<P>Joyce Bateman, director of counseling services at OTC and chair of the College's Behavioral Intervention Team (BIT), said domestic violence affects a large portion of our local community, which includes the Colleges students, staff and faculty.</P>
<P>"It is a national epidemic and Springfield and our surrounding communities are not immune.&nbsp; Our domestic violence problems have actually been rising.&nbsp; Just last year, Springfield had a dramatic increase in aggravated assault cases of 22 percent and 70 percent of the aggravated assaults were domestic related," Bateman said.</P>
<P>Amber Allen, Prevention Specialist, Substance Abuse &amp; Violence Prevention Division for the Community Partnership of the Ozarks, said the Silent Witness Project was started by the Violence Free Families Coalition. </P>
<P>"The exhibit serves as a vivid reminder of the issue of domestic violence, which is often a hidden epidemic in our community. Victims of family violence often remain silent out of fear and feel they have no power and no voice. Some survive tell their stories and some do not," she said.</P>
<P>Bateman said the Silent Witness display should help increase awareness among students, staff and faculty of the impact domestic abuse has on the community.</P>
<P>In addition to the display, students, staff and faculty will have access to materials about domestic violence along with community resources.</P>
<P>"Both witnesses and victims will no longer remain silent," she said. </P>
<P>Allen said interpersonal violence does not have a type.</P>
<P>"It can happen to persons of any age, gender, race/ethnicity or sexual orientation. Three out of four Americans personally know someone who is or has been a victim of domestic violence. One in every three women will experience domestic violence in her lifetime," she said.</P>
<P>If anyone knows about someone in a violence situation, they can call the 24 Hour Hotline at 417-864-7233 (SAFE).</P><I>

                    <P>A lot of&nbsp;times twins will go their separate ways when it comes to picking a career.</P>
<P>But twins Allison and Alissa Rowden and even older sister Amanda of Strafford are studying healthcare in the Health Science Program offered to junior and senior high-school students at OTC.</P>
<P>"It was just something we all wanted to do when we got older," said big sister Amanda, 17.</P>
<P>Remarkably, all of them decided their career choice on their own with little discussion among them and each told their mother separately.</P>
<P>"After we told her, we realized we were all going to do it," Allison, 16, said.</P>
<P>Faith Mann, the health science instructor at OTC, said the program the sisters are enrolled in offers high-school students a chance to prepare for the college portion of the instruction.</P>
<P>"This program is a great opportunity for those high school students that are interested in health care professions.&nbsp; We are proud of our students and are happy to assist in them in any way possible," Mann said.</P>
<P>"It gives students the ability to make decisions about their future in the healthcare industry while receiving high-school and college credit."</P>
<P></P>
<P>Students in the program can earn up to 35 hours of college credit in a variety of healthcare topics including medical terminology, health science and health nutrition.</P>
<P>Amanda, along Allison and Alissa, who were born a minute apart, are considering different types of healthcare careers.</P>
<P>Alissa is looking at physical therapy while twin Allison is looking at dental hygiene. Amanda is considering becoming an oncology nurse.</P>
<P>Alissa is looking at the physical therapist career because of the care she received when she hit her back recently.</P>
<P>"Everyone was super nice and they explained everything to me and what I needed to do," she said.</P>
<P>All three play basketball at Strafford and the twins said they get along most of the time, especially when its time to study. They have a habit of responding to a question at the same time with the same answer.</P>
<P>After finishing their studies at OTC, they will be heading off to different colleges, including OTC, to continue their studies. </P>
<P>"Weve enjoyed it here. We've had a good time," Amanda said. "Its going to be hard to go off to college. I havent been away from them."</P>
<P><I></I></P>

		<title>Songwriter tells OTC students about his big break</title>

                    <P>Kevin Renick calls it a "cosmic coincidence" when the St. Louis songwriter refers to the tremendous break he got when he wrote a song entitled "Up in the Air."</P>
<P>"I was handed a music career," said Renick, who spoke to several music and songwriting classes and the general public at OTC recently.</P>
<P>Renick told students that he wrote the song months before it was announced that George Clooney was making a movie that happened to have the same title as Renick's song.</P>
<P>"I had been laid off from my job as an advertising proofreader and wrote a song about life's struggles and uncertainty. That just happened to be what the movie was about," he said.</P>
<P>The coincidences continued when Renick learned that the movie's director, Jason Reitman, was in St. Louis filming the movie and was holding a lecture there one night. Renick recorded his song on a cassette tape the night before the lecture and brought it with him to Reitman's appearance.</P>
<P>During the question and answer period of the event, Renick worked up the nerve to stand up and ask Reitman if he'd like to hear a song with the same title as the movie. Reitman said yes and six months later, movie producers contacted Renick about putting the song in the movie.</P>
<P>Renick's original version from the cassette tape was used in the movie.</P>
<P>Since then, Renick has been able to concentrate on his music, and in 2008, he began performing in public after battling decades of stage fright.</P>
<P>"I was too chicken to perform on stage," he said.</P>
<P>But Renick performed in a backup position, playing at a small St. Louis coffee shop. He was so impressive that the owner asked him to come back alone and perform more shows. Renick agreed, over came his fears and now performs and lectures around the region.</P>
<P>While technology has made music recording and distribution easier, it can't gain someone a hit song, according to Renick.</P>
<P>"I'm an old guy and you do it with both determination and as a craft. For some, the timing is just right, but you need to watch out for the coincidences in your life, too," he said.</P><I>

                    <!-- @font-face {   font-family: "Cambria"; }p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal { margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: "Times New Roman"; }a:link, span.MsoHyperlink { color: blue; text-decoration: underline; }a:visited, span.MsoHyperlinkFollowed { color: purple; text-decoration: underline; }div.Section1 { page: Section1; } -->
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Tuesday marks the beginning of another spring semester, another semester where strong enrollment is expected.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Last spring, overall enrollment grew 16.6 percent and 11.5 percent on the Springfield campus. Double-digit increases are likely again this semester. Enrollment is up at all of the campuses and education centers.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&ldquo;Enrollment for spring continues to be very strong. Every campus, center and OTC Online are showing strong enrollment growth,&rdquo; said </span><span>Dr. Hal Higdon, president of Ozarks Technical Community College.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>The Waynesville and Lebanon Centers are seeing dramatic growth in enrollment, as well as enrollment for on-line classes. It is obvious that people continue to see our College as the best choice for pursuing a better life.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Joan Barrett, associate vice president for student affairs, said the enrollment increases reflect the role OTC plays in a student&rsquo;s future.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&ldquo;Some have definite career and vocational plans for themselves and others are asking for help in determining their path. Each of the students knows that education beyond high school is a necessity. Each is aware that completing an associate's degree with OTC prior to transferring to a four-year school is an economical way to secure a degree,&rdquo; Barrett said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>While OTC Online is looking at substantial increases this semester, seated classes are being scheduled early in the morning and late into the evening to help students with nontraditional schedules.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&ldquo;Our Late Night classes (offered at 10 p.m. or later) continue to grow by leaps and bounds and have come into their own,&rdquo; said Dr. Reita Gorman, dean of general education, who added that at least 17 late-night classes are scheduled for this spring.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Barrett said that in addition to students working their way through college to earn a four-year degree and start of a career, there are other students who are looking for training in a new field.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&ldquo;Many have been in or made attempts to join the workforce only to find their skills are in need of updating. The good news for our community is that many of these individuals find their way to OTC,&rdquo; she said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em><span>Steve Koehler is coordinator of publications at Ozarks Technical Community College. Contact him at</span></em><span> </span><a href="mailto:koehlers@otc.edu"><span>koehlers@otc.edu</span></a><span>.</span></p>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>Ozarks Technical Community College continues to see substantial enrollment growth in the midst of the current economic downturn.</p>
<p>Four-week numbers for the spring semester show enrollment up 6.9 percent overall from last spring with a total of 10,588 students taking classes. Credit hours taken have increased 7.7 percent to 101,999.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe that half of the increase is based on the hard times we are in and half is due to OTC continuing to meet the needs of people in our service area,&rdquo; said Dr. Hal Higdon, president of OTC.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it shows that when the times are tough, they know that going to a community college is the best thing they can do to improve their lives. More education and training are going to help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The College saw growth at its main campus as well as at its other education centers, at the Richwood Valley campus in Christian County and within its online offerings.</p>
<p>&bull; Branson/Hollister Education Center: 319 enrolled, up 25.1 percent</p>
<p>&bull; Lebanon Education Center: 362 enrolled, up 2.3 percent</p>
<p>&bull; Waynesville Education Center: 120 students (first spring semester of classes)</p>
<div>&bull; Richwood Valley campus: 807 enrolled, up 19.6 percent</div>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>&bull; Online courses: 1,175 enrolled, up 35.8 percent.</p>
<p>&bull; Main campus: 7,358 enrolled, up 2.3 percent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In these difficult economic times, it is even more important for higher education to be convenient, accessible, and affordable for all.&nbsp; The College strives to support the local economies of communities within the service region through high quality workforce, technical, and general education,&rdquo; said Dr. Sue Moore, dean of extended campuses and college outreach.</p>
<p>Dr. Higdon said it has been the College&rsquo;s No. 1 priority to offer students what they need to earn a degree or certificate and gain employment. This is all done with minimum cost to taxpayers with the lowest local tax rate in the state, he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are doing more with less more than any other school in the state. I think that says a lot about how<strong><em> </em></strong>we operate OTC ,&rdquo; Dr. Higdon said.</p>
<p>And, according to Dr. Higdon, the College will continue to be the portal through which students can improve their employment chances and help turn the economy around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In an economy where the wheels are<strong><em> </em></strong>in danger of coming off, we are the<strong><em> </em></strong>mechanics that can keep the car running. People can&rsquo;t get jobs without proper training and it only makes sense to come to a community college like OTC to get that training,&rdquo; he said.</p>

                    <div class="pr_imagewrapper">/SRC_1.jpg</div>
                    <p>Thursday&rsquo;s Ozarks Technical Community College commencement will have a little extra meaning for a group of employees from Springfield Remanufacturing Corp.</p>
<p>The 16 workers will be the first class from that company to have completed more than three years of classes in a program customized for them by taking the classroom to the work site. In addition, classes started at 4 p.m. instead of the normal 5 or 5:30 to meet their work schedules.</p>
<p>In all other aspects, the classes they took were exactly the same as those taken by other OTC students.</p>
<p>The group will graduate Thursday with Associates in Applied Science in Manufacturing Technology degrees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been a win-win-win for the company, the college and the students. It was quite a success,&rdquo; said Cindy Stephens, director of innovative career/technical education programs.</p>
<p>The classes were first held starting in the fall semester of 2008 at SRC to allow workers to go from work to the classroom uninterrupted. But eventually, the students had to take a computer class on the OTC Springfield Campus and, according to Stephens, the workers liked coming to a college campus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The students asked to come to the campus for their classes. It was less distracting for them instead of still being at work,&rdquo; Stephens said.</p>
<p>The workers took college classes in everything from English and political science to technical math and machine shop.</p>
<p>Last week, the workers were finishing up an Introduction to 3D Design and Drafting class. The instructor, Ben Christiansen, said he&rsquo;s happy for his students to have accomplished what they did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud of them and what they&rsquo;ve been able to do. The program has really worked for them,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>And the students have worked the program hard, too. In addition to working full shifts at SRC this semester, they have been taking classes four nights a week.</p>
<p>Anonymous surveys of the students showed they were pleased with the program and the classes they took.</p>
<p>They listed things like being able to network with SRC co-workers and getting a degree as positives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is an opportunity to better yourself and your position in the company with very few strings attached. It is a tremendous opportunity and I am glad to be a part of it,&rdquo; one student wrote.</p>
<p>Stephens said the program also addressed all the misconceptions some may have had of what college is.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can target what those students need. It doesn&rsquo;t have to just be about Shakespeare,&rdquo; she said.</p>

		<title>State National Guard medics to test at OTC</title>

                    <p>Medics from the Missouri Army National Guard will converge on the OTC Springfield campus Saturday to participate in field medical scenarios involving the college&rsquo;s mannequins.</p>
<p>The 50 medics from across the state will be using the college&rsquo;s group of medical mannequins that can simulate an array of injuries and maladies that the medics will have to treat as if they were in the field treating wounded soldiers.</p>
<p>It is the first time that OTC and the Missouri National Guard have joined efforts in the medical training scenarios. The event will be held in Lincoln Hall from 8 a.m. until noon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The scenarios are run to help keep up the medics&rsquo; medical skills. The medics are the primary source when to comes to providing care in the field. It&rsquo;s where the rubber meets the road,&rdquo; said Sgt. Darren Maute, the readiness noncommissioned officer for the 206<sup>th</sup> Area Support Medical Company based in Springfield.</p>
<p>The injuries and wounds the medics will face in the scenarios will run the gamut of what they would see in combat, including blast injuries from improvised explosive devices (IEDs), head injuries, gun shots and Sarin gas. Some of the medics will be seeing these wounds for the first time at the training exercise.</p>
<p>The mannequins have the ability to replicate symptoms through computer software that presents medical personnel with various issues, anything from shortness of breath to heart problems to a drug overdose. The mannequins can bleed, sweat, roll their eyes, even turn blue in places due to lack of oxygen.</p>
<p>Maute said the closest installation to have the type of equipment OTC has is in San Antonio, Tex. He said the National Guard plans to use OTC&rsquo;s facilities twice a year to train medics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is too good of an opportunity at OTC not to be training here more often. We are really excited,&rdquo; Maute said.</p>
<p>Michelle Howard, director of the Allied Health Simulation Center, said she has always wanted to work with the National Guard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are a community college and we are here to assist with the education of not only our students but the community as well,&rdquo; she said.</p>

                    <p>Chelsea Joy hasn&rsquo;t used the phrase &ldquo;free time&rdquo; much over the past three years while at OTC.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because Joy has had very little time for any else but taking classes, volunteering and working.</p>
<p>Since coming to OTC when she was a junior at Parkview High School through the college&rsquo;s Career Center, Joy has taken class loads ranging from 12 hours in the summer to 18 hours in the fall.</p>
<p>At the young age of 19, Joy will earn two associate degrees &mdash;&nbsp;an Associate of Arts this summer and an Associate of Arts in Science &mdash; by the end of next school year. &nbsp;She carries a 3.30 GPA and will move on to study dentistry.</p>
<p>But academics are only one part of what Joy does on and off campus.</p>
<p>She also is a member of the OTC Honors Program and the OTC Student Government Association, while volunteering at Cornerstone Church developing lesson plans for children there, and working 32 hours a week for a telemarketing company.</p>
<p>In October, Joy and her husband, Nicholas, a member of the U.S. Navy, will be expecting their first son.</p>
<p>Joy can smile with pride when reflecting on her time at OTC.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was an average high school student when I came here and the Career Center really helped. I started at OTC with 20 college credits earned in high school through dual enrollment. The center instilled a strong work ethic and lifelong learning skills and gave me confidence to do more,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Joy hopes to graduate with honors. She is doing well in the summer classes, which exceed the normal number a student can take in the summer. She was given special permission to exceed the maximum of nine hours of classes.</p>
<p>Joy said she has wanted to go into dentistry since she was in the fifth grade and became fascinated with her father&rsquo;s gold teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew I wanted to be a dentist,&rdquo; she said, although she thought dental assisting might be as far as she could go.</p>
<p>But with the encouragement she got from health science instructors at OTC, Joy made a career change and decided to become a dentist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were great teachers. No one told me before that I had potential and would go far. They took the time for me. OTC has given me the foundation to be successful wherever I go,&rdquo; she said.</p>

                    <P>When Tim Noel found himself bouncing from part-time job to part-time job, it was his mother and the state's MoManufacturingWINs program at Ozarks Technical Community College that changed his life.</P>
<P>As his frustration in being unable to find full-time work grew, his mother, Rebecca Noel, an accounting clerk in the technical education and special academic programs at OTC, told her son about the MoManufacturingWins program.</P>
<P>The program is a statewide training network that creates opportunities for students to obtain the training they need to work in modern manufacturing shops. It enables students to attend a community college and earn industry-recognized credentials that validate students' mastery of skills in specific areas of manufacturing.</P>
<P>"I had done jobs here and there and finally, I called my mom up and said, 'I can't keep this up. I can't support a family like this.' I had a fiancé. My mom told me about the program and kept me posted," the 33-year-old Noel said.</P>
<P>Noel went into machine manufacturing despite not having any experience with heavy machinery, although he had a background in carpentry.</P>
<P>"The program was amazing. The instructors had so much knowledge to share. I was scared to death of the math, but the instructors broke it down and talked us through it," said Noel, who plans to marry his fiancé in July.</P>
<P>After completing the 17-week course to receive his certificate in Machine Tool Technology this past spring semester, Noel, a native Springfieldian, is working full-time at Clay &amp; Bailey Manufacturing in Kansas City, where he operates lathe equipment.</P>
<P>"It was a complete 180 degree turnaround in my pride and confidence after earning the certificate. I came away with that confidence, skills and knowledge to walk in somewhere and say that this is what I can do. I'm here if you want me. No more nervousness. I stand just as good a chance as anyone now to get a job."</P><I>
<P> </P>
<P></I></P>

		<title>Student earns scholarship to study in South Africa</title>

                    <P>When Wade Southwell had a chance to come from San Francisco to Springfield, he took it. When he had a chance to attend OTC, he took that, too.</P>
<P>Now, with a chance to spend a year in South Africa, the OTC student will take advantage of that opportunity as well and head there this summer as a rare recipient of an $18,000 Boren Scholarship.</P>
<P>With the help of Loren Lundstrom, the college's international students director, Southwell made application for the prestigious scholarship that took six months to complete.</P>
<P>"Naturally, we were both very excited when he was selected," Lundstrom said. "I think this whole process has been a great learning and growing experience for Wade.&nbsp; I can't wait to talk with him when he returns from South Africa next year to finish his AA degree here at OTC."</P>
<P>Southwell is believed to be the first student from southwest Missouri to receive such a scholarship.</P>
<P>"I have an interest in South Africa. I've always been fascinated about the cultures and history of Africa," he said. "It's something I'm passionate about. I think it will expand my opportunities."</P>
<P>Southwell will study language for a year in South Africa, concentrating on the Zulu language at the University of KwaZulu  Natal.</P>
<P>He will have two private language lessons a day and also study the African culture. </P>
<P>"Living in Africa for a year would be a daunting challenge for anyone, but I'm confident that if anybody can do it, Wade can," Lundstrom said.</P>
<P>Southwell said he plans to use his pending experience in South Africa towards his eventual goal of working in foreign service. </P>
<P>After graduation from OTC next year, he plans to go to the University of Pennsylvania to participate in their African Studies program. </P>
<P>Graduating from OTC will be the cap to a quite unexpected educational journey for Southwell.</P>
<P>&nbsp;"Whenever I started school, I didn't have a lot of expectations. I didn't expect I would be such a high-achieving student," he said. "I just tried to be prepared and worked really hard."</P>

                    <p>Terri Howard&rsquo;s involvement as a student at OTC extends well beyond the classroom door.</p>
<p>In fact, saying Howard is involved at OTC is an understatement; instead, she&rsquo;s jumped in with both feet.</p>
<p>The second-year student is president of the Professional Land Care Network (PLANET) student organization, a member of the Spanish Club, Phi Theta Kappa honors society, the OTC Performing Arts Choir, the Society for the Awareness of the Natural Environment (SANE) and a student work-study receptionist in the OTC Middle College office.</p>
<p>The first-generation college student, who drives from Mount Vernon five days a week, said she has seen what her family has gone through without going to college and wants to make a better life for herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I spend a lot of time away from home. I want people to see I&rsquo;m a hard worker,&rdquo; said Howard, who wants a career in urban forestry.</p>
<p>Discipline is important when being involved in so many groups, Howard said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I make sure I have all my studies done above anything,&rdquo; said Howard, who has straight As.</p>
<p>In addition to carrying a full load of classes, Howard has headed up important projects for some of her organizations.</p>
<p>PLANET has recently worked on sites needing landscape improvements. This past fall, the group refurbished trails and mulched trees at the Valley Water Mill Park area. It also did some cleanup work on the OTC Springfield campus.</p>
<p>Last week, the Spanish Club started a drive to collect eyeglasses for children in Mexico; they&rsquo;re also collecting money and toys for victims of the Joplin tornado.</p>
<p>Howard, who will graduate in May with an associate degree in turf and landscape, said she enjoys all the time she spends on the OTC Springfield campus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love walking around OTC. Instructors see me everywhere. I enjoy getting to know them,&rdquo; she said.</p>

                    <p>When Jerry Kendall recently sold his plumbing business of nine years, he wanted to do something different.</p>
<p>He found what he was looking for at Ozarks Technical Community College.</p>
<p>The 44-year-old grandfather of two graduated last spring with a transfer degree. While a student at OTC, he was involved in the Student Government Association, the Honors Program and the Spanish Club.</p>
<p>He remains an active OTC alum by offering his services as a tutor in math, English, computers and Spanish, as well as working with the Disability Services department as a scribe for those students enrolled in Community Enrichment Center courses who cannot see or hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I took a sophomore seminar class with Julie Edwards, director of Disability Services, it piqued my interest in helping others,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t have been happier in my decision to do what I&rsquo;m doing now. When I was running a business, all we talked about was the business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kendall would like to work in the health and senior services area. He has an interest in water quality management and the Department of Natural Resources.</p>
<p>After graduation, Kendall transferred to Missouri State University, where he is majoring in political science and public administration. He is currently serving a one-semester internship in Jefferson City in the office of the Speaker of the House.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My duties vary from acting as a page delivering memos to and from the various floors to helping write capital reports that go out to constituents of the speaker. I&rsquo;m used in gathering data for legislation,&rdquo; Kendall said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an election year and that tends to ramp up the tensions a bit. People are trying to get things done and get legislation passed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Thursdays and Fridays, Kendall returns to Springfield and helps other students taking classes at CEC and Richwood Valley.</p>
<p>Having been a non-traditional student at OTC and MSU, Kendall sees the contrast in enrollment makeup between the two institutions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a four-year school, you typically see one or two other students my age with my background. You see a real presence at OTC because it is a community college and that&rsquo;s great,&rdquo; he said.</p>

		<title>Student finds way to get off street by coming to OTC</title>

                    <P><B></B></P>
<P>The road to educational success has taken Wade Southwell from living on the streets of San Francisco to the classrooms of OTC. </P>
<P>And thanks to the relationships he struck up with faculty and staff at OTC, Southwell will soon graduate and move on to Brown University to study international relations. After graduation from Brown, Southwell plans to join the U.S. Air Force and become a public relations officer.</P>
<P>Southwell , who has been on his own since age 14, was living on the streets when he had an opportunity to get a free bus ticket out of town. The destination was Springfield and Southwell took it.</P>
<P>"I had gone to community college off and on while in California. I was homeless when I got here but wanted to go to school," he said.</P>
<P>Southwell got some financial assistance and work study employment that helped with costs but still had him living on Springfield streets and walking seven miles from the city's south side every day to attend class.</P>
<P>"It was hard to show up for class everyday dealing with the things I've had to deal with like sleeping outside and keeping your clothes in trash bags and hiding them in the bushes at night so they aren't stolen. I would shower at school," he said.</P>
<P>"I was exhausted walking to school. I was getting good grades, however."</P>
<P>Thanks to Jill Rea, OTC's assistant registrar-communications, Southwell was awarded a MOHELA Director's Choice Grant last semester and has been able to secure an apartment and other living essentials, including a bicycle to ride back and forth to school.</P>
<P>"He has come such a long way and is doing so well here at OTC," Rea said. </P>
<P></P>
<P>In fact, Southwell's grad were so good he was able to join the OTC Honor's Program and is a member of the Honors Student Council.</P>
<P>Southwell said he is grateful for the help OTC provided him that allowed him to get off the streets and into the classroom.</P>
<P>"I saw that continuing my education would lead me out of the situation I was in. Coming to OTC helped me turn things around for myself. If it hadn't been for OTC, education wouldn't have been an option," he said.</P><I>
<P></I></P>

                    <P>Wade Southwell had an exciting and educational 2014 and the new year looks to have as much or more to offer the OTC student.</P>
<P>Southwell is a recipient of an $18,000 Boren Scholarship in 2014 and is believed to be the first student from southwest Missouri to receive such an award. He has been studying language at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa since the start of the fall semester.</P>
<P>"My first semester was largely spent studying hard and making friends with other students," Southwell wrote in an email from South Africa. "About 80 percent of the population of my province is Zulu speaking, so I get the opportunity to use my language skills on a daily basis."</P>
<P>The OTC student earned the highest mark in his Zulu language studies class, which, he said, is an accomplishment considering most of his classmates are students whose home languages are Xhosa, Tswana or Ndebele, languages very similar to Zulu. </P>
<P>Southwell has attracted a lot of attention during his short time in South Africa. Hes been featured in a local newspaper story and on the universitys online Web site.</P>
<P>"This is really cool because they refer to me as Wade Southwell from Ozarks Technical Community College in Springfield, Mo.," he wrote.</P>
<P>An excerpt from the Web story reported that when Southwell was asked his opinion on South African life and Zulu culture, he said:</P>
<P>"Initially I had to adjust to everything here in South Africa, including how people think and interact, and the differences between our societies. It was overwhelming at first but I immersed myself in the culture and history, and I have embraced all these new perspectives and it is everything that I had hoped it would be and so much more."</P>
<P>Southwell said Christmas was celebrated in South Africa much like it is in other places.</P>
<P>"South Africa was&nbsp;colonized by the Dutch and the British, both Christian nations, so most South Africans celebrate&nbsp;the same&nbsp;holiday traditions as Christians in the United States, Europe and elsewhere," he wrote.</P>
<P>Southwell will spend another semester in South Africa, which begins in February.</P>

                    <P>As the Thanksgiving holiday approaches, thoughts turn to food, family and festive occasions.</P>
<P>This week, food will be on the minds of faculty, staff and students at OTC as the college takes part in National Hunger Awareness Week, collecting items to donate to area food panties.</P>
<P>From there, the food will be donated to those in need, including some OTC students.</P>
<P>"OTC refers students to use food pantries in our service area," said Joan Barrett, associate vice chancellor for student services. "It makes sense that we would choose to support the very establishments that make it possible for a group of our students and their families to make ends meet."</P>
<P>The collections will take place all week at all of the college's campuses and centers. There are collection bins at all of the locations. The food donations should be non-perishable. No glass containers or out-of-date products can be accepted.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Food collected at each location will go to a specific food pantry that serves that area.</P>
<P>The locations and pantries are:</P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;Springfield campus: Crosslines and Rare Breed</P>
<P> Richwood Valley campus: Least of These</P>
<P> Table Rock campus: Christian Action Ministries</P>
<P>&nbsp;Lebanon center: L-Life Food Bank</P>
<P> Waynesville center: Good Samaritan</P>
<P></P>
<P>At Springfield, representatives from Crosslines and Rare Breed will be on campus to explain their organization and to offer help to those who are in need.&nbsp; Crosslines will be on campus today and Rare Breed will be on campus Tuesday. Both presentations will take place in ICW 108C at 1 p.m. Students will be able to speak with representatives about receiving food.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The food drive has been planned and supported by Enactus and other student organizations.</P>
<P>"This is about students helping students. Some students use Crosslines or Rare Breed. They get services from there," said Kara Hasty, a member of Enactus. "We want to help students have a food source. Anyone can give."</P>
<P></P>
<P> </P>

<p class="MsoNormal">Brittney Tucker began singing in elementary school while growing up in Arkansas.</p>
<p>Over the years, while listening to her mother sing, Brittney developed a voice of her own, a distinctive voice that stands out when she sings.</p>
<p>After moving to Springfield five years ago, the soprano has been training to become a professional singer. She is studying vocal performance and musical education at OTC.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I grew up with my mom singing. She has an awesome voice. Singing came naturally to me. I&rsquo;m a pastor&rsquo;s kid. I sang in the church choir. In high school, I decided it was something I wanted to do. I want to travel and sing,&rdquo; said Brittney, a Kickapoo High School graduate who was a member of the performance choir.</p>
<p>At a recent recital of the OTC Performance Choir, Brittney, 20, wowed the audience with her engaging solo rendition of the Christmas carol, &ldquo;Jesu Parvule.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brittney finds it hard to describe the sensation that she experiences when performing on stage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something comes over me. I go into this place. I know I am singing and it feels like something else. It&rsquo;s overwhelming,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>When she&rsquo;s not singing, Brittney said she enjoys drawing or performing in theater. She&rsquo;s also performed in some musicals, too. She likes listening to anything from John Mayer to the latest country music hits.</p>
<p>Brittney returned to classes this week to continue her studies and plans to transfer to Missouri State University to earn an advanced degree in voice. She said the training she&rsquo;s gotten at OTC has gone a long way to improving her talent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like the program here. I was skeptical at first to come to a community college but I was surprised and learned a lot. I will always remember OTC for what and how they helped me,&rdquo; she said.</p>

                    <P>The $2,500 first-prize check couldn't have come at a better time for OTC student Dylan Hall of Nixa.</P>
<P>Hall &nbsp;was working two jobs and selling his plasma in order to make ends meet when he learned he had was the grand-prize winner in the Missouri Lottery's "Tools 4 School:&nbsp; The A+ Giveaway" promotion. </P>
<P>The random drawing was held from a field of current and former A+ scholarship recipients who entered the promotion. Hall's name was pulled as the top winner. </P>
<P>Hall said he entered the contest while lying in bed one night. He had to write a sentence about what the A+ program did for him.</P>
<P>"Thanks to A+, I am able to attend OTC and not have to worry about anything except books&nbsp;- which allows me to save up my extra earnings to put towards my four-year college fund," Hall wrote.</P>
<P>The 20-year-old forgot about the contest until he was sitting in class one day looking at his email.</P>
<P>"I found an email that said I had won," he said. "I had to read it a couple of times. I asked the student next to me to read it to make sure I was reading it right. I had never won anything."</P>
<P>It not only was a big windfall for Hall but also for two other OTC students. The others included $1,000 winner Lindsey Bilyeu&nbsp;of Chadwick and $400 winner Jacob Shoemaker&nbsp;of Springfield.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Hall isn't sure what he will do with the money but for now it's going in the bank since he's been pulling money out for living expenses. The money will give him a chance to bill up his nest egg.</P>
<P>Up until he won, Hall has been making ends meet by making regular trips to a local plasma center to sell his plasma.</P>
<P>"I get a check for $200 each month so it helps with the expenses. I'm on my own and going to school," he said. </P>
<P>The whole experience has been a learning lesson for Hall.</P>
<P>"Enter those contests," he said "And no one should pass up the change to be part of the A+ program."</P>

                    <P>Nigel Holderby will never forget the events of July 8, 2011, that changed his life and his career forever.</P>
<P>Even today, as Holderby ponders the incident, the OTC graduate gets a hitch in his voice as emotions bubble up.</P>
<P>"That one event altered my future," he said speaking for students in a speech he gave before 8,000 in attendance at the recent OTC commencement.</P>
<P>Holderby was seriously injured in an accident two summers ago while working as a paramedic on an ambulance that was hit head on by a dump truck traveling at highway speed.</P>
<P>Two people died in the accident and Holderby was severely injured. He underwent several surgeries for a severely damaged shoulder, arm and knee. His teeth were also damaged.</P>
<P>"I was left reeling psychologically. Reality changed dramatically that day," he said. </P>
<P>The injuries would prevent him from returning to work as a paramedic so Holderby decided to enroll at OTC and earn an associate of arts degree. He plans to be a teacher.</P>
<P>"It didnt take long to figure out that the only way I was going to rebound would be through education. Taking off my public service helmet and putting on an academic cap would be a crucial step in my life," he said.</P>
<P>At the time he enrolled, Holderby wasn't sure what he wanted to do but he had been a trainer with the Springfield Fire Department for many years and taught a photography class for OTC's Center for Community Enrichment Center.</P>
<P>"I really enjoyed teaching and history was of a great interest to me," he said.</P>
<P>While at OTC, Holderby made the Dean's List and joined Phi Theta Kappa. He became the honor societys president and regional vice president.</P>
<P>"I was able to connect with some truly gifted and influential educators," he said.</P>
<P>During his commencement speech, Holderby urged his fellow graduates to continue on their education paths.</P>
<P>"Don't ever stop learning. Whether you're transferring to another schools or if you've receive a certification and will be immediately shifting to a job, please don't let your positive educational experiences end here. Continue to soak up every bit of knowledge you can," he said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P> </P>

<P>The bullying was so bad that Corey Coffman left high school in her junior year.</P>
<P>But when she came to OTC to earn her GED, she was awarded free credits to take a class at no cost. She enrolled and was the first in her family to go to college.</P>
<P>Now, she is on her way to earning her Associate of Arts in Teaching Degree and eventually wants to teach math in a small, rural school district.</P>
<P>Last week, Coffman received the Missouri Community College Associations Student Leadership Award in St. Louis.</P>
<P>"I wasn't a very good student in high school. I was shy and not very outgoing. I was like the weird girl sitting in the corner. That brought on the bullying," she said.</P>
<P>Coffman changed her demeanor at OTC by getting involved in campus activities.</P>
<P>She joined Enactus and became the group's treasurer. She also works in student services several hours a week through the colleges work-study program.</P>
<P>"All of the work taught me to appreciate OTC for what it offers students in terms of activities and work opportunities," Coffman said.</P>
<P>Coffman has excelled in the classroom at OTC.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Pam Spain, one of Coffman's instructors, said the student brings "an intellectual curiosity and joyful spirit to each class period."&nbsp; </P>
<P>"Corey is the kind of student that makes me want to be a better teacher because she truly cares about learning," Spain said.</P>
<P>Coffman said she has found math to be the subject she enjoys most and wants to pass her excitement for it on to others.</P>
<P>"It's easy for me. I ask a lot of questions. I'm very inquisitive. It helps me stay on topic," she said.</P>
<P>When not at school, Coffman and her boyfriend spend every Thursday with a young, 13-year-old friend named Jo Jo. Coffman, her boyfriend and Jo Jo spend time bowling, going to movies and hanging out.</P>
<P>It's something she could have used when she was younger and being bullied.</P>
<P>"I've known him since he was little. He's looked up to me. I know how tough it was in school to make friends. It was rough," she said. </P><I>
<P> </P></I>

                    <p>The term &ldquo;pay it forward&rdquo; is not lost on Jesse Allen.</p>
<p>In January, Allen found himself in dire financial straits and came to the OTC Foundation in need of money to be able to get to school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Transportation was a huge issue. Trying to get to school was a hassle,&rdquo; Allen said.</p>
<p>Allen received two $25 gas cards from the Foundation&rsquo;s Student Emergency Fund/Care to Learn Fund.</p>
<p>The fund allows students to continue their educational aspirations without the fear of where their next meal will be or how they will get to class or pay utilities. The fund prevents students from having to drop out or take a leave of absence due to an unforeseen emergency during the semester.</p>
<p>Since start of fund in December 2007, 173 students have received funds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was such a blessing. It&rsquo;s hard to ask for help. It was incredible what the Foundation did for me,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>But what Allen did a few months after receiving the cards was also incredible. He returned to the Foundation office twice in the spring to pay back the value of the gas cards. No student had ever done that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were shocked,&rdquo; Allen said of the Foundation staff&rsquo;s reaction to giving the money back. &ldquo;They probably thought, &lsquo;Is this guy OK?&rsquo; But I felt good about doing it. &rdquo;</p>
<p>Life for the 22-year-old Allen has been a series of ups and downs.</p>
<p>He was adopted at a young age and later discovered in high school that his biological mother had died. His 1 1/2 &ndash;year-old son died of SIDs several years ago.</p>
<p>Allen suffered from his son&rsquo;s death and became addicted to drugs. He is just now beginning to see his life turn for the better as he gets work and is able to go to OTC.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bounced around from place to place and fooled away a lot of time and money. I needed to grow up and mature,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>And paying back the money was one of those signs of maturity Allen now possesses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought if I&rsquo;m doing alright now, somebody else out there is not alright and could use the money,&rdquo; he said.</p>

		<title>Student puts A+ scholarship to use with business</title>

                    <P><SPAN lang=EN></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Brice Clark may not look it, but he's been in business almost half his life. Thanks to his class work and the A+ scholarship at OTC, he's been able to become an even better business operator.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Clark started his DJ music business Spark Sound &amp; Entertainment when he was in the eighth grade and decided to put on a dance party that summer at a neighborhood pool.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Summer roll along and Clark didn't get a job until the last week of summer when someone took him up on his offer, paid him $100 (as Clark can best remember) and his business was off and running.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>After graduating from high school, Clark enrolled at OTC last year and earned an A+ scholarship. He is studying business.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"The material I learn throughout my courses can be applied to my business and career directly," he said. "My public speaking class teaches me about meeting with clients. In computer class I was learning how to do spreadsheets for the company."</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>The A+ scholarship has helped Clark in two ways: 1) He can save money on tuition and fees since the scholarship covers those expenses. 2) He can take the money he saves from earning the scholarship and plow it back into his business.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"I have benefited from the A + program in many ways, however the most important has been the ability to stay a full-time student while being able to maintain my full-time entertainment business," he said. </P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"Instead of putting money into education, I am allowed, by the A + program, to get the same course material and learning as I would elsewhere but instead I can invest the money saved into my own company."</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Today, he operates a full-time business from his downtown Springfield storefront and had dozens of bookings a month that puts about 10 people to work each week.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"We are a full-blown entertainment company with disc jockey service, photo booth and videography services," he said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Eventually, Clark would like to open business offices in other cities including Kansas City and St. Louis. But that will come after he graduates from OTC news spring.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"OTC has enabled many opportunities for me, and I am honored to be apart of the A+ program," Clark said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P><I>

                    <p>With four years of unemployment between them, Ron Vazquez and Mohamed Issolah were desperate for work when they turned to the Missouri Career Center for help.</p>
<p>And now, thanks to the customized aluminum-welding program offered at OTC, the two will soon be earning a living with Polar Tank Trailer LLC in Springfield.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going well for me. I thank God. I got laid off from an industrial job a year ago,&rdquo; said Vazquez, who was in the U.S. for only a month before enrolling in the program, after coming from Puerto Rico to live with his mother in Ozark.</p>
<p>Students in the program are trained in various welding techniques and then go to work for Polar. The course is three weeks long and there were eight students in the last class.</p>
<p>Sherry Coker, director of the OTC Center for Workforce Development, said the center worked with the state&rsquo;s career center to develop the program with Polar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This program is a great example of how OTC&rsquo;s Center for Workforce Development works to meet the needs of our area employers. Polar Tank entrusted us to help them find skilled aluminum welders,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We then worked with our colleagues at the Missouri Career Center who were able to identify dislocated former steel welders who, with a skills upgrade, would be excellent candidates for employment in the aluminum welding industry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The customized program is an accelerated, hands-on course that includes teaching skills and competencies that Polar Tank was looking for and also provides graduating students with portable, industry-recognized credentials endorsed by the National Association of Manufacturing.</p>
<p>Mohamed Issolah, a native of Algeria who has been living in the Ozarks since 2001, had a welding background but had been out of work for three years before being referred to the Polar program by the career center.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked for them to find me a job, any job. When they told me about this program, I jumped at the chance. The training I received here has been excellent,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m excited to have a job waiting for me when I&rsquo;m finished.&rdquo;</p>

                    <P>Ryan Nichols picked the right table when he attended a jobs fair at OTC earlier this year.</P>
<P>"I went right to the Chase table. It was the first interview I had and they hired me," said Nichols, who graduated in May with a business and marketing degree.</P>
<P>Today, Nichols is finishing his orientation training with the company at its Springfield headquarters and will soon be a service representative for Chase's Slate credit cards.</P>
<P>Nichols represents a growing number of OTC graduates who are finding work within 180 days of graduation. </P>
<P>The most recent survey of Allied Health and Technical Education graduates showed that 83 percent of the graduates found degree-related work within six months.</P>
<P>"I wouldn't have known the terms and uses of the Internet without OTC's training. I learned a lot and definitely enjoyed the classes," he said.</P>
<P>Melanie Allen is now the events coordinator at the Springfield Incredible Pizza. It's a job she got just weeks after graduating with a transfer degree with an emphasis in business. Allen's job requires her to book group events, help with fund-raising efforts and field donation requests.</P>
<P>"Since I worked at OTC while going to school, I learned how to talk to strangers,"said Allen, who was an OTC student ambassador.</P>
<P>Chris Francis is now a neuro-trauma emergency room nurse for Cox Hospitals, a job he got this spring right after graduating with his Associate's in Science in Nursing.</P>
<P></P>
<P>In 2011, he graduated from OTC with a practical nursing certificate.</P>
<P>"With both of these achievements, I was able to immediately join the workforce after graduation, which also prepared for me for the National Certification for Licensed Nurses Exams," he said.</P>
<P>"Without these certifications I would not have the privilege of working in the Nursing field. I feel fortunate to have gone to OTC for the training and education."</P>

		<title>Students flock to OTC's weekend engine class </title>

                    <p>Ozarks Technical Community College continues to use flexible course scheduling to meet the demands of its student population.</p>
<p>In addition to the &ldquo;night-owl&rdquo; classes started this semester, which are a big hit, a new Friday night-Saturday morning course in engine repair is proving popular, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are trying to offer more sections of courses at various &lsquo;off&rsquo; times. The engine repair course is one more example,&rdquo; said Layton Childress, dean of technical education.</p>
<p>In addition to offering several sections of the two-part engine course from 6-8:50 p.m. on Fridays and from 9 a.m. &ndash; noon on Saturdays, the course is expected to be offered from 5-7:50 a.m. in the fall, along with two more sections of the Friday night-Saturday morning class.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of these different offerings are simply an attempt by the transportation department to meet the needs of the students,&rdquo; Childress said.</p>
<p>Kerry Wrinkle, chair of the transportation department, said the engine course is popular because of the time it&rsquo;s offered and for the sudden interest he&rsquo;s seen in engine repair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an opportunity for people to come and take something they haven&rsquo;t taken before. It&rsquo;s an opportunity for people to see if this is something they want to go into for a career,&rdquo; Wrinkle said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In the class, students disassemble engines donated to the school by General Motors and identify the various parts and learn what the parts do. The class does not include learning about the on-board computer that regulates most of the engines functions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The overall Automotive Technology program is one of the 10 most popular programs offered at OTC and Wrinkle said he has seen resurgence in the popularity of car repair among younger students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;The role of the technician has changed with the addition of the computer in the car. Retirees are being replaced by kids who have worked on computers,&rdquo; Wrinkle said.</p>

                    <p>Betsy Woodsmansee (center in photo) and Courtney Cook (left) still can&rsquo;t stop talking about having their plays chosen for the coveted Mid-America Theatre Conference Playwriting Symposium.</p>
<p>The symposium, held earlier this month in Chicago, gave the two OTC students a chance to have their submitted plays used in the symposium&rsquo;s dramatists lab, where veteran actors, writers and directors produce the students&rsquo; plays on stage.</p>
<p>Over the course of the weekend, the students were on hand for a staged reading of their plays, which is performed at the conference before an audience of professionals and academics from all over the world. A feedback session followed, moderated by a professional playwright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was scared and intimidated but the prize was getting to go and see your play performed,&rdquo; Woodsmansee said.</p>
<p>Woodsmansee&rsquo;s 10-minute play entitled &ldquo;You and Me and Them,&rdquo; is about two friends who have to give up mutual imaginary friends. Cook&rsquo;s play, entitled &ldquo;Last Time,&rdquo; is about a couple going through a relationship breakup.</p>
<p>The two students, who have been writing plays for a number of years, were excited to see their plays read.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was so different seeing veteran actors doing your play. It was amazing to see them work,&rdquo; Cook said.</p>
<p>Said Woodsmansee: &ldquo;I got tears in my eyes. It was an emotional experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For OTC, it was a rare moment for the theater arts program.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rarely do I see so many participants from one institution at the symposium. Rarely do I see community colleges at this conference and rarely do I see undergraduates invited to present in the dramatists lab. I think it says a lot that OTC consistently sends undergraduate students to this conference,&rdquo; said Jon Herbert, theater arts instructor at OTC, (seated right in photo).</p>
<p>Appearing at the symposium and having their submitted plays performed has given the two students in OTC&rsquo;s Beginning Playwriting class a shot of confidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The symposium showed me that I&rsquo;ve got potential and that I&rsquo;m not writing for the heck of it,&rdquo; Woodsmansee said.</p>
<p>Said Cook: &ldquo;To have people who have been doing it for years saying &lsquo;you&rsquo;re talented,&rsquo; is really something I&rsquo;ll remember for along time.</p>

		<title>Students heading online for summer classes</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
                    
                    <p>Summer classes begin Monday at Ozarks Technical Community College, but the parking lots won&rsquo;t be as packed with cars and the hallways as jammed with students as during the fall and spring semesters.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because many students will be firing up their computers and connecting online to take their summer classes at OTC at their convenience.</p>
<p>As of the start of this week, nearly 2,000 students were enrolled in at least one online course. That&rsquo;s about half of the total summer enrollment. That number is expected to increase as summer enrollment continues through the middle of next week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The percentage of visiting students taking online courses increases greatly in the summer because of both the convenience factor and the cost effectiveness of OTC Online&rsquo;s courses. Online enrollment in the summer is big and OTC Online is one of the fastest-growing areas within the college because of the needs of students,&rdquo; said C. DeWitt Salley Jr., College Director of OTC Online.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe convenience is the main reason students take online courses in the summer. They can still travel, vacation, work, or do whatever else they want while getting ahead or catching up in their college careers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The popularity of online courses at OTC has been growing over the years.</p>
<p>In the just-completed spring semester, more than 6,400 students took online courses. The students, connecting to OTC Online from all over the world, enrolled in 397 separate course sections. OTC offers five associate degrees and two technical certificates entirely online.</p>
<p>This summer, online courses are being offered in everything from anthropology and environmental science to social psychology and technology for teachers. The courses are so popular that a number of sections are at capacity.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Salley said OTC Online would continue to work to meet students&rsquo; needs for more courses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OTC Online strives to serve more and more students by developing new, innovative, and needed online courses, programs, and partnerships. The community can expect OTC to continue being a leader in online teaching and learning among community colleges nationwide,&rdquo; he said.</p>

		<title>Students help restore tribute car of legendary racer</title>

                    <p>A tribute race car restored by students in the auto collision program at Ozarks Technical Community College will be the centerpiece of this year&rsquo;s OTC Car and Motorcycle Show.</p>
<p>The finished 1969 Chevy Chevelle, a replica of the car driven by local racer Dave Goldsberry, will be on display April 24 from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. as part of the College&rsquo;s Community Day event.</p>
<p>In addition to the public viewing, the vehicle&rsquo;s 550-horsepower engine will be started for the first time</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a very exciting time for the program and the students who have been working for a long time on the car. They got to see what the old cars were like. We can&rsquo;t wait for the public to come see the car and hear that engine turn over,&rdquo; said Kerry Wrinkle, department chair of the transportation program.</p>
<p>Goldsberry, who died of natural causes about 10 years ago, drove the original car in 1972 and 1973. It was destroyed in a wreck shortly after that.</p>
<p>The car that became the current tribute car was originally built and raced by the Bates Brothers in Fair Grove in the late 1980s and was retired until Randy Bowman, now with Transport Graphics, found the car behind a body shop in Nixa.</p>
<p>It was Bowman who decided to make the Bates car a tribute car to Goldsberry. He contacted Wrinkle last summer and brought the OTC collision program into the mix to help with initial bodywork and painting</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kerry thought the kids would enjoy the car and would like the experience of working on a real race car,&rdquo; Bowman said.</p>
<p>Many manufacturers and companies donated parts and time to restoration of the car, including Reliable Chevrolet, which donated the engine.</p>
<p>Students who worked on the car appreciated the chance to put their hands on a classic racing machine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was beautiful. It was amazing,&rdquo; said Jake Ely from Springfield. &ldquo;I think about being able to touch the car and say I&rsquo;ve been around a car like that. I&rsquo;ve been able to pick up knowledge to know what I&rsquo;m talking about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Visit www.otc.edu to see a video about the tribute car.</p>

		<title>Student's love for cars earns her state award</title>

                    <SPAN lang=EN>
<P dir=ltr align=left><IMG border=1 hspace=20 align=top src="/Taressa_Johnson_OTC_Breaking_Traditions_2X3.jpg" width=400 height=601></P>
<P>Taressa Johnson has been around cars almost all of her life.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Her grandfather operated car repair shops in Willow Springs, and the OTC student would spend hours with him as he worked in the garage.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"I got familiar with tools. My boy friends were mechanics. We'd talk about cars," said Johnson, who drives a 1986 Camaro that shes worked on.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>That love for cars drew her to the College's Auto Collision Repair Technology Program, and as a non-traditional student of the automotive program, she recently won the state's 2012 Breaking Traditions Secondary Daphne Jones Spirit Award.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>The state program is operated under the umbrella of the Missouri Center for Career Education. The program focuses on students who are considering or pursuing careers that are non-traditional for their gender and provides information and expertise in the areas of career awareness, exploration and planning. It offers support services for student who are enrolled in one of OTC's career/technical education programs.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"The award recognizes non-traditional students who are working toward careers traditionally held by members of the opposite gender," said Michele Charlebois-Didreckson, OTC's Breaking Traditions coordinator.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"It also shows students there is support to get thorough the unique situation they may come upon while in class. It gives them self-confidence and increased passion for their chosen career."</P>

<P dir=ltr align=left>"I said to myself that I was either in trouble or something real good had happened," Johnson said, and when she was given the good news, "I thought she was kidding."</P>

                    <p>Some downtown Springfield sidewalks are more interesting to look at thanks to a project involving OTC art students.</p>
<p>The Storm Drain Reveal Project, sponsored by the James River Basin Partnership, the City of Springfield and the Springfield Regional Arts Council, brought artist and downtown storm drains together to promote water quality protection.</p>
<p>The finished murals will be unveiled at next week&rsquo;s First Friday Art Walk.</p>
<p>OTC students designed and painted eight of the 10 drains selected for painting. The artist&rsquo;s ideas surrounding the theme of water quality protection were submitted to a committee of city and basin staff who selected the winners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a tremendous opportunity for our OTC Fine Art Students to gain experience while informing the community of the connection the storm drains have with our waterways.&nbsp; They are making a huge aesthetic and environmental impact on the Springfield community,&rdquo; said Kat Allie, Fine Arts instructor and manager of the OTC Fine Arts Gallery in the Gillioz.</p>
<p>It is a public education project to inform the community on the connection the storm drains have with local waterways. Organizers hope the murals will continue to raise awareness long after the initial planned events. The artwork is expected to last about three years on the sidewalks.</p>
<p>Reproductions of the murals will be displayed in the Canvas Galley on South Avenue during First Friday and during the weekend of ArtsFest where the public will be asked to vote on the People&rsquo;s Choice award.</p>
<p>Phil Caudle designed his storm drain mural in front of the Springfield Convention Center to show a lake, as it should be, without pollution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Storm drains go to the lake and if you pollute the drains, you pollute the lake,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The Fine Arts department and its students will be on hand Saturday at our second annual Community Day event from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. on the Springfield campus.</p>
<p>In addition to artists showing off their talents, students from the department&rsquo;s guitar playing and songwriting classes will also be performing.</p>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>For college students using social-networking sites as job-hunting sources can be a blessing for most and a curse for some, according to experts at Ozarks Technical Community College&rsquo;s Career Employment Services Center.</p>
<p>Kathy Christy, director of Career Employment Services at OTC, said that on the plus side, social networking sites can help job-hunters identify contacts who, in turn, may know people at the companies for whom a person wants to work.</p>
<p>However, those job hunters who have a tendency to use their personal Web sites on Facebook, MySpace, Twitter and LinkedIn for posting, what Christy calls, &ldquo;digital dirt,&rdquo; could end up being turned down for a position based on what an employer finds online.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the employers we talk to check an applicant&rsquo;s Web site or search for one. It depends on the business. If the business already uses those tools, they check an applicant. More and more employers are using that as an avenue to check an applicant. It&rsquo;s a trend we&rsquo;re seeing. It&rsquo;s a hot topic in career services,&rdquo; Christy said.</p>
<p>The OTC center staff offers some advice and tips on policing your personal Web site and how to make it work to one&rsquo;s advantage.</p>
<p>&bull; Update your online professional profile on a regular basis.</p>
<p>&bull; Be aware of how you will be perceived by other business people in your online social network.</p>
<p>&bull; Post content relevant to your job search with a description of who you are and what you do.</p>
<p>&bull; Don&rsquo;t post controversial content on your profile that would damage your reputation or that a prospective employer might read.</p>
<p>&bull; Don&rsquo;t mention your job search if you&rsquo;re still employed and want to keep your search below the radar screen.</p>
<p>&bull;Don&rsquo;t forget about the real world.</p>
<p>Most important, Christy said, &ldquo;if you have any digital dirt, get rid of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The OTC Career Employment Services office is available at 447-6964</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Shelby Ammerman learned a big lesson after being featured in a News-Leader series of stories about poverty and its impact on local residents.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;Family means a lot, especially when you&rsquo;re struggling,&rdquo; said the OTC freshman.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ammerman, along with her mother and younger sister, was profiled in the newspaper project that went into detail about the family&rsquo;s struggles to make ends meet and cope with what poverty throws at them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The stories have put Ammerman in the spotlight.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been kind of hectic. People from the past have read it in the newspaper and contacted me. My fifth-grade elementary teacher sent me an email wondering how I was doing. Customers where I work are asking me how I&rsquo;m doing,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Her mother, Carmen, made an important statement in one story when she said education is the way to a better life.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ammerman has adopted that philosophy and is enrolled at OTC, taking some classes that start at 7 a.m. and others that end after 9 p.m. She also works at McAllister&rsquo;s.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting used to college. OTC is not as hectic as a university would be. I&rsquo;m getting my general education courses here and will transfer later. The time I spend with my teachers and classmates is very good,&rdquo; said Ammerman, who graduated from Hillcrest High School.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ammerman isn&rsquo;t sure what career she will choose. She&rsquo;s considering psychology, becoming a lobbyist or maybe a teacher.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ammerman and her sister, Ellie, are close and the little sister wants to follow her big sister&rsquo;s footsteps in getting an education.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re seven years apart but we&rsquo;re really close and we get along. She&rsquo;s growing up fast and is really intelligent. She&rsquo;s in the International Baccalaureate program at Pipkin and is writing the play for the school,&rdquo; Ammerman said.</p>

                    <SPAN lang=EN>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Every graduate who walks in Thursday's OTC Commencement at JQH Arena will have a story of accomplishment and self-fulfillment when they receive their degree or certificate.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>But few will eclipse Alex Heisterman's pure joy when he receives his associate transfer degree.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Listen for Alex's name toward the end of the program. Alex is autistic. He is on the high end of the autism spectrum, and he will wait in the arena tunnel where he can walk around before coming out to receive his degree because sitting for long lengths of time is difficult for Alex due to his autism.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>As a child, Alex experienced difficulties with expressing his thoughts and maintaining his focus. As he entered public school, Alex had challenges interacting with other students. He was able to overcome those challenges through support services he received throughout his primary education and while he's attended OTC. </P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"If I could give out an award to one student, Alex would get a gold star. He's taken some of the most difficult classes OTC has to offer and he's shined in every one," said Julia Edwards, assistant dean for Disability Support at OTC. "In Alex, I see incredible potential, growing maturity. I just see joy. I could not be more proud."</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Thanks to Alex's success and the success of other OTC students on the autism spectrum, OTC is exploring the development of a specialized program for students with high functioning autism.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Everyone is impressed by Alex's work, including the Missouri University of Science and Technology where he'll study computer&nbsp;science in the fall. </P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"I'm a guy who has potential who needs a little push in the right direction. OTC has given me that push,"&nbsp;he said. </P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>He said he will miss Jeff Jones, a resource counselor in the disability services department.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"I had no idea that I held such a privileged position in Alex's life," Jones said. "He and his family have placed a lot of trust in me. What began as an advisor-advisee relationship now turns to pure friendship. I am proud of how hard he has worked to have accomplished so much."</P>
<P></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Alex is headed to Missouri S&amp;T and he hopes to become a video game creator, which he's been interested in since age 12.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"He'll get that chance after picking up his degree from OTC. And if you don't see him get his diploma, chances are you'll know when it happens.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"My mom will be screaming like a cheerleader," he said. "This is one big step in my future."</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P><I>

		<title>Students take advanatage of dual credit opportunities</title>

<P dir=ltr align=left>Hayley Peryer wanted to get a jump on her college career while attending Sparta High School.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>So, when she learned of OTC's Dual Credit program, she jumped at the chance and is taking a college math and English composition classes online this semester.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"It's a great way to get your general education classes taken care of before coming to college full-time," the Sparta senior said." I was looking for higher math classes and we didn't have any at the high school but I found what I wanted at OTC."</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Dual credit is OTC's program offering college coursework to high school students who are nearing completion of high school curriculum. All of the classes are offered at the high schools in either a seated or online format.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>By completing college credit in high school, it saves the student time and money once they transition to college. </P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>But there are other important benefits from the program.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"Research tells us that students who have taken advantage of dual-credit learning opportunities are more likely to enroll in college, complete a college degree, and have higher college GPAs," said Tracy McGrady, dean of academic and student affairs.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"They also experience a smoother transition to college, which can be pretty tough for some students."</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>The program also enjoyed an increase in enrollment this semester when tuition for the courses was cut from $70 per hour to $35. Enrollment increased to 431 students this fall, up from 140 last fall.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"We know that students who complete dual credit class are more likely to complete their freshmen year in," said Kim Greene, coordinator of dual credit and high school admissions. "They are also more likely to succeed in their second year in college as well."</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>In addition to offering the program to local high schools, homeschooled students were eligible to take the classes as well.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"I have been meeting with the homeschool networks promoting the program," Greene said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Said McGrady: "OTC is fortunate to have many wonderful partnerships with area high schools, and we continue to see more and more students take advantage of it.&nbsp;Our mission is high quality, affordable, and accessible education. We want to provide that to as many as we can."</P>

<p class="MsoNormal">As the holiday season begins, students and staff at Ozarks Technical Community College are doing more than just completing their semester of work.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This year, hundreds of students and staff are reaching out to those in need with various drives and assistance that will help out families over the holidays.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;The community outreach by our students and staff during the holidays typifies their generous nature. I am so pleased to see them all take an active role in helping those in need over the holidays,&rdquo; said Dr. Hal L. Higdon, president of Ozarks Technical Community College.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Dental assisting and dental hygiene students are collecting food items for the La Trinidad Hispanic Church food pantry.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The dental program&rsquo;s faculty is skipping their traditional Christmas gift exchange this year and instead, is collecting money for the Help Give Hope organization, which assists needy families, in particular children, in southwest Missouri.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Associate of Science in Nursing Bridge program is working on a food drive for Ozarks Food Harvest and is also adopting a family to provide their needs during the holidays.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A food drive spearheaded by the College&rsquo;s SIFE group finished its collection recently with more than 10,000 items delivered to the Branson food pantry. Similar food drives are scheduled for the Springfield and Richwood Valley campuses.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">At the Waynesville Education Center, the Student Government Association is participating in the Angel Tree Program, sponsored by the Good Samaritan Resource Center. Students and staff are buying age-appropriate gifts that eventually will find their way to needy children on Christmas.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The SGA members at the Lebanon Education Center are collecting items for holiday-themed baskets that are being sold to students during a silent auction. The money raised will go to COPE, a not-for-profit agency in Lebanon that provides help for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault along with their families in Lebanon and Laclede, Texas, Dallas and Wright counties.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The classified staff is adopting a male student and his three children who are facing medical and financial issues this year.</p>

                    <p>Paul Sundy, Ozarks Technical Community College graduate and local business entrepreneur, was awarded the first OTC Distinguished Alumni award.</p>
<p>The award was presented during the College&rsquo;s recent 2010 Commencement ceremony.</p>
<p>Sundy is the owner/operator of a number of Springfield&rsquo;s most popular restaurants and lounges, including Big Whiskey&rsquo;s American Bar and Grill, Parlor Eighty-Eight Lounge, Fedora Social House, the Whole Hog Caf&eacute; and Einstein Bros. Bagels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paul was chosen because of the positive impact he has had not only on revitalized downtown Springfield, but on the entire community. &nbsp;He has contributed to economic growth, created jobs, and demonstrated tremendous entrepreneurial spirit,&rdquo; says Dr. Hal Higdon, president of Ozarks Technical Community College.</p>
<p>Sundy is actively involved in the Springfield Area Chamber of Commerce and regularly involves each of his brands in various community charity events.</p>
<p>A graduate of Marionville High School, Sundy earned his Associate of Arts degree from OTC in 2001. He met his wife while attending OTC; they now have two children.</p>
<p>Sundy opened his first business, Icon nightclub, in 2003. He followed that with the opening of Big Whiskey&rsquo;s in 2005, Parlor Eighty-Eight in 2007 and Fedora&rsquo;s in 2008.</p>
<p>Sundy received the first Missouri license for Arkansas&rsquo; Whole Hog Caf&eacute;. He has opened a Big Whiskey&rsquo;s in Little Rock, Ark., and plans to open 15-30 more Big Whiskey&rsquo;s and Parlor Eighty-Eights over the next 10 years.</p>

		<title>Tax deadline a reminder to file FAFSA</title>

                    <p>For those students planning to attend OTC or their parents, it is a good idea to keep your just-completed income tax returns out for a day or two before you file them away.</p>
<p>The Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, is the form students must complete in order to determine how much financial aid he or she is eligible to receive.</p>
<p>Several forms are needed to complete the application; completed 2010 tax forms, 2010 W-2 forms, 1099 forms and other statements of interest earned. The sooner the FAFSA is completed and submitted, the sooner students will learn what sort of financial aid they could receive.</p>
<p>The 2011-12 application form has an improved layout online for an easier and more accurate application process; it is free and available online at www.fafsa.gov</p>
<p>&ldquo;We definitely don&rsquo;t recommend waiting.&nbsp; If additional documentation is required or your FAFSA is selected for the verification process, it could add 8-12 weeks to the usual processing time.&nbsp; However, remember that in order to meet the priority deadline for 2011-12, the college must receive your FAFSA results no later than July 1, 2011,&rdquo; said Kim Cary, assistant director of financial aid and coordinator of federal programs.</p>
<p>Cary said applicants also should keep in mind that the college receives thousands of FAFSA applications each semester, all of which must be processed even if the applicant chooses to attend a school other than OTC.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Students who have or will be filing their FAFSA can anticipate hearing from OTC&rsquo;s Financial Aid Office following receipt and processing of FAFSA information, or you may contact us,&rdquo; Cary said.</p>
<p>If you require assistance with your FAFSA, Student Services on the Springfield campus will be conducting help sessions on the second floor Student Services computer center later this summer. You can also get immediate help at the Student Services office and cyber center.</p>
<p>Student Services is available year-round to assist students applying for financial aid.</p>
<p>For more information about the financial aid application process, visit www.otc.edu/financialaid. You can also call 417-447-6900 or email financialaid@otc.edu.</p>

		<title>Team assists OTC students facing challenges</title>

                    <p>Being a college student presents a host of challenges and sometimes those challenges can result in a student needing help in difficult times.</p>
<p>The Behavioral Intervention Team (BIT) at Ozarks Technical Community College was recently established to work with students who need assistance with issues that span from class absenteeism to threats of self-harm or harm to others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The main purpose of the team is to identify students who may be struggling and offer them resources to help them through a difficult time in their lives,&rdquo; said Joyce Thomas, director of counseling and advising at OTC.</p>
<p>Five faculty and staff make up the core team. About two dozen more faculty and staff are on the advisory committee. A page on the OTC Web site allows faculty and staff to report issues of concern about a student at www.otc.edu/bit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The team collects and reviews all information and evidence to define specific problems and behaviors. Where there is no threat of imminent danger, the team determines the appropriate approach to address the behavior,&rdquo; Thomas said.</p>
<p>Clues to a student who is struggling with issues include excessive absences, changes in personal hygiene, falling asleep in class, poor attendance and excessive weight changes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t going to pounce on everyone reported but it would be foolish not to take a more proactive, consistent approach. We want to take that proactive approach with services that will help students before they reach a crisis stage,&rdquo; Thomas said.</p>
<p>Based on what the team finds, students can decide themselves on receiving free counseling. In other cases, Thomas said, no response may be necessary or immediate intervention might be called for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In some cases, the best way for faculty to approach a student is just talk to them about their concerns,&rdquo; Thomas said.</p>
<p>Faculty and staff are receiving training over the next few months in how to use BIT and how to help identify students who may need assistance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to provide a way to identify students whose behavior is of concern and assist in protecting their health, as well as the members of the OTC community,&rdquo; Thomas said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">February is Career and Technical Education Month in Missouri and across the country.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Those programs have been sited by federal officials as vital to the future of education in the U.S. Just this week, Secretary of Education Arne Duncan came out strongly for career and technical education.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span>&ldquo;For all its importance, the role that CTE plays in building the nation's economic vitality often gets overlooked. Too many educators assume that career and technical training is for the last century, not this one. Many reformers treat CTE as old school--rather than as a potential source of cutting-edge preparation for careers,&rdquo; he said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Nationwide, more than 15 million high school and post-secondary students are enrolled in CTE courses. And more than half of high school graduates who participate in CTE today now go on to some form of postsecondary education.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;Our technical education programs provide our students with the needed training and skills to join the region&rsquo;s workforce or to go on to a four-year institution to further their education,&rdquo; said Dr. Hal L. Higdon, president of OTC.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Thousands of those technical education students will participate this month in the annual SkillsUSA competition that gives them a chance to put their skills to work.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>OTC&rsquo;s technical education students will be among them, participating Feb. 25 in the district SkillsUSA competition at the Springfield campus.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Competitions will be held in Automotive Collision Repair, Advertising Design, Health Knowledge Bowl, Television Production, Video Product Development, Preschool Teaching Assistant, Welding and SkillsUSA technical written tests. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Winners of the district contests will be eligible to compete in the state contest to be held March 31-April 2 at Linn State Technical College. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The nationals are held in the summer in Kansas City. Last year, s</span>ix OTC students won top honors there.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;SkillsUSA provides the opportunity for students to showcase and demonstrate the skills they are learning in their OTC technical education programs,&rdquo; said Layton Childress, OTC&rsquo;s dean of technical education.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;The students who participate and compete in SkillsUSA gain self-confidence, and with SkillsUSA partnering with business and industry, the students are provided an opportunity to network with future employers.&rdquo;</p>

                    <!-- @font-face {   font-family: "Cambria"; }p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal { margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: "Times New Roman"; }div.Section1 { page: Section1; } -->
<p class="MsoNormal">The Mid-America Technology Alliance has an ambitious strategic plan prepared for 2011.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Sherry Coker, business manager for OTC&rsquo;s Center for Workforce Development and MATA administrator, said the Alliance will spend the new year concentrating on three areas: talent development, talent attraction and awareness and communications.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A new Web site will be developed with links for businesses, IT professionals and entrepreneurs to use as a resource. Coker said the site would also be designed to attract elementary and secondary students who might be considering a career in technology.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;As students consider IT-based professions, we want to highlight technology jobs these young adults may not know exist. IT has changed so much over the last 10 years, and today&rsquo;s technology jobs are far more varied and reach beyond computer programming and desktop repair and maintenance,&rdquo; Coker said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s technology job choices include systems engineers, IT project managers, software developers, technical writers, computer/network security consultants, GIS specialists, web designers, and more.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are more than 40 members of the alliance, including those from technology companies as well as government entities.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The group would like to develop ways to show students that IT professions are financially viable and rewarding career choices.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The alliance plans to perform a talent pool assessment and develop ways to strengthen the pool. It also wants to encourage members to offer internships and mentoring programs.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Assessments will also be made to determine what skills local businesses need in technology areas, what technology professionals desire in a community and ways to attract top talent to the region.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Member teams have been formed to help meet community needs in areas including education, talent pool and business development.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The education teams will work on increasing the number of students choosing careers in high-technology fields and collaborating with post-secondary colleges and universities in ways to make such promotions a reality.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The talent pool team will work to both develop and attract high-tech talent while the business team will identify ways for businesses to share technology resources and information.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;We have a lot of exciting plans and a lot of hard work ahead of us in 2011,&rdquo; Coker said.</p>

		<title>The future of robots being taught now at OTC</title>

                    <P></P>
<P>The demand for robotic programs has been on the rise since the first programmable digital robot was brought to life in the 1950s.</P>
<P></P>
<P>At OTC, the study of robots is approached from several aspects, making use for both the ominous-looking robotic arms and the building and programming of machines that come in a kit and resemble dogs and bugs.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Everything from how the machines are used in manufacturing to the science of robotic programming is offered at both the OTC Springfield Campus and the OTC Lebanon Center.</P>
<P></P>
<P>"In Lebanon, we teach students the basics of robotics, their systems and what they do. It covers everything from programming the machines to maintaining them," said Keith Dinwiddie, the robotic instructor at Lebanon.</P>
<P></P>
<P>"A lot of industries are looking into automation since it's perfect for jobs that result in injuries. The repetitive actions of painting or welding can be done by robots, saving people from being injured by doing the same thing day in and day out. It frees up the workforce to do the quality-control work, maintenance and programming," Dinwiddie said.</P>
<P></P>
<P>At the Springfield campus, Tiffany Archer makes use of NXT Lego project robots to teach her students how robots are programmed.</P>
<P></P>
<P>"Legos have a nice appeal to students, many of whom played with them as a child. This class teaches them to program differently by programming robots," Archer said.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The robots used in the classroom can be made into dogs, spiders and a machine with a claw. The robots can be programmed to respond to voice commands, follow a certain path or stop when they come to the edge of a table to avoid falling off.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Archer said what the students learn in the classroom about programming robots is directly applicable to what's taking place in manufacturing today.</P>
<P></P>
<P>"There is more and more robot automation taking over in manufacturing. Our students will be well positioned for success," Archer said.</P>

                    <p>By Steve Koehler</p>
<p>Three therapy programs at Ozarks Technical Community College have been cited recently for a number of prestigious awards from national and state organizations.</p>
<p>For the first time, the college&rsquo;s Respiratory Therapy Program was named one of the 10 best programs out of approximately 400 in the country and won the 2009 Excellence in Respiratory Care Education Award from the Committee on Accreditation for Respiratory Care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are slowly becoming a nationally known program. People are coming from throughout the region,&rdquo; said Doug Pursley, the respiratory program director.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All three of the therapy programs are popular. All are full enrollment wise and there are good opportunities in the therapy fields. Placement rates are at 100 percent for all three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The directors of the Occupational Therapy Assistant and Physical Therapy Assistant programs also have been honored.</p>
<p>Becky McKnight received the Physical Therapist Assistant Educator of the Year award from the American Physical Therapy Association this year and Becky Jenkins recently was named the Outstanding Occupational Therapy Assistant Educator from the Missouri Occupational Therapy Association.</p>
<p>The physical therapy program has had a three-year average pass rate of 97 percent compared to the national average of 92 percent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The faculty and students of the program help to meet one of the program goals of modeling health lifestyles by participating with a variety of fitness activities each week,&rdquo; McKnight said.</p>
<p>Jenkins said the occupational therapy program has seen tremendous growth in the last few years with enrollment rising from nine students per class in 2006 to 20 students in 2009.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We provide students with experiences that help them to develop useful clinical skills but also focus on personal and professional development. We have seen an increase in wages and positions, in part, due to the tremendous efforts of our graduates in the workplace,&rdquo; she said.</p>

                    <SPAN lang=EN>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Thanks to a new outreach pilot program, tutors from OTC's Speckman Tutoring and Learning Center are expanding their services to younger students in need of a bit of assistance.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Working in conjunction with Big Brothers Big Sisters of Springfield, a number of tutors from the tutoring center are spending several hours on Tuesdays helping students in grades 6-12 with their math, science, writing and study skills.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Tara Lawless, a full-time math tutor at the TLC, came up with the idea.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"I was part of a professional development project with Big Brothers Big Sisters called Lunch Buddies, where we have lunch with students. One of the case managers asked me if I knew of any grants she could apply for to get tutoring for some of the younger students. I said I didn't know of any grants; however, I said we could help," Lawless said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"We decided as a department that we wanted to come in and offer help. It's a six-week pilot program. If it goes over well, which I think it has, we will return in the fall for the entire school year."</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>So far, the work has gotten rave reviews.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"I think its gone over awesome," Lawless said. "I had a student in the first week who sat down with no back pack, no books, no pencils and said at the start of the session that he didn't want to be here. By the end of the session, he was thrilled to have completed his 10-question math homework.I think it was the first time he completed his homework."</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Sierra, a seventh-grader whose last name was not released, said she liked working with her tutor. Her grandmother was having trouble helping Sierra with her homework.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"The tutor was funny. He helped me with everything. The tutoring helps me get my studies done," she said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Corey Harrington, one of the student tutors from OTC, said Lawless asked him to join the project.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"I wanted to do some volunteer work. Having the students ask questions and poke holes in your knowledge is something I like. Having to answer why is it a certain way makes me look at the problems a little more deeply", Harrington said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>Students in Ozarks Technical Community College&rsquo;s culinary arts program are cooking up a great future for themselves in addition to elevating the program one of the 10 most popular offered at the College.</p>
<p>The two-year program is accredited by the American Culinary Federation and has more than 180 students enrolled in culinary arts and hospitality management. The program also offers a baking certificate for those who want to study cake making and decorating, European pastry making along with yeast and quick-bread making.</p>
<p>The program offers students a chance to gain a meaningful education in culinary arts that allows them to find employment fairly quickly.</p>
<p>Lisa Gardner, interim division chair of Hospitality and Culinary Arts at the College, said in addition to the quality of the program the College offers, there are two other reasons for the surge in students wanting to enter the culinary arts program.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are a lot of cooking shows nowadays and the country in general has promoted the culinary arts,&rdquo; Gardner said, adding that the College is filling the need for workers in culinary arts and hospitality management.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is workforce development in that there is a large pool of employers, over 400 restaurants in the area. There are plenty of opportunities out there. Several students have gone to work at the new Hilton hotel in Branson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gardner said about 70 percent of the students in the program are majoring in both programs, giving them more flexibility when it comes to looking for work.</p>
<p>Students also gain real-world experience in the student-operated Scallions restaurant that is open one day a week. Some students cook the dishes in the kitchen while others work as wait staff serving customers.</p>
<p>Julie Viorel of Springfield, who started in the program last year, already has a business degree and is working on her baking certificate in addition to taking the culinary classes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed the culinary arts. It&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m very comfortable with. I wanted to take my skills up to the next level. The classes are fun. There&rsquo;s a lot of camaraderie; everyone works together well,&rdquo; Viorel said.</p>
<p>Viorel is considering opening a caf&eacute; when she finishes her studies at the College.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I enjoy coming to school here. With the reputation OTC has, I knew this would be a good fit for what I wanted to do in the future, she said.</p>
<p>Michael Greinke, a second-year student from Springfield, learned his early cooking skills from his parents, who operate the Galloway Station Bar and Grill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always loved to cook. I decided to go here because I heard that heard they had a great program. Cooking is a passion for me. I just really want to learn,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Greinke, who would like to eventually open a restaurant in Greece where his family is from, said he looks forward to classes at the College.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyday, I come to school I get to cook and eat. I get fed. I get very excited,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Vivian Taylor, originally from Chicago and a second-year culinary student, got her cooking experience feeding her five children.</p>
<p>Fried chick, baked macaroni, fried catfish and spaghetti are her best dishes but the first-generation student said she wants to learn more and eventually open a Caribbean-Soul Food restaurant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I enjoy cooking. I knew before I moved here that I wanted to attend a school for culinary arts. I had heard a lot of nice things about OTC. I wanted to learn different things, styles and techniques,&rdquo; Taylor said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I came here.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve had great instructors and I met great people. I love it here,&rdquo; Taylor said.</p>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>The future is now for Ozarks Technical Community College students who are filling programs that hold the greatest employment promise.</p>
<p>OTC&rsquo;s top credit programs, based on student enrollment this spring, are: business and marketing, early childhood development, accounting, culinary arts, graphic design technology, health information technology, networking technology, drafting and design technology and practical nursing.</p>
<p>The programs students have selected fall in line with the top job openings the state expects to have between now and 2016.</p>
<p>According to the Missouri Economic and Research Information Center, the state forecasts the need for 10,600 childcare workers, 8,186 accountants and about 12,000 cooks and food preparation workers over the next seven years.</p>
<p>Enrollment in OTC&rsquo;s culinary arts programs has more than doubled in the past five years and health information technology enrollment has almost doubled in four years. There are waiting lists for students wanting to enter some allied health programs.</p>
<p>OTC is meeting some of the workforce demands with graduates finding well-paying jobs, including dental hygiene positions paying an average of $58,996 and physical therapy assistants earning $45,270.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are meeting some of the needs of the business community,&rdquo; said Kathy Christy, director of OTC&rsquo;s Career Services office. Her staff is in constant touch with businesses and their leaders about job demands of the future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been calling other companies to see where their needs maybe. Once OTC has that information, we can discuss the type of courses that need to be designed and offered to better educate our students in the skills that will be needed and the types of jobs that will be available.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Advisory boards for all the technical and allied health programs also go a long way to providing input into program development.</p>
<p>In addition to credit programs, OTC&rsquo;s Continuing Education Center offers short-term certification programs that are eight to 11 weeks long for programs like pharmacy technicians, certified nursing assistants and medical assistants.</p>
<p>The state forecasts 6,500 nursing aides, 5,000 pharmacy technicians and 2,400 medical assistants will be needed by 2016.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The noncredit healthcare programs meet needs of individuals seeking quality, affordable programs that train them for a specific job and do so in a matter of weeks,&rdquo; said Dana Patterson, director of Continuing Education at OTC.</p>

                    <!-- @font-face {   font-family: "Cambria"; }@font-face {   font-family: "American Typewriter"; }p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal { margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: "Times New Roman"; }a:link, span.MsoHyperlink { color: blue; text-decoration: underline; }a:visited, span.MsoHyperlinkFollowed { color: purple; text-decoration: underline; }div.Section1 { page: Section1; } -->
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Ozarks Technical Community College prides itself in producing graduates who are ready to take their place in the workforce after earning their associate&rsquo;s degree or training certificate.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Another segment of the OTC&rsquo;s student population &mdash; transfer students &mdash; continue their education after graduating from OTC.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Last spring, nearly half of OTC graduates went on to a four-year school. By learning more, transfer students have a chance to earn more.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Current OTC students who are planning to transfer after graduation can prepare for that transition at the annual Transfer Fair at OTC&rsquo;s main campus on Oct. 28, starting at 11 a.m.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Representatives from 15 colleges and universities will be on hand to talk to students about their future education needs.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&ldquo;Universities are coming here because they like the quality of our students. They are good students and have demonstrated that while attending OTC,&rdquo; said Joan Barrett, associate vice president for student affairs.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The College Board reports that someone with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree will earn 60 percent more than someone with a high-school diploma throughout their working lives. Four-year degree holders will earn about $18,000 more annually than someone with just some college credit.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The transfer student is so important to local colleges, like Drury University and Missouri State University, that they have opened transfer desks at OTC to talk to students.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Drew Bishop, a computer information systems student at OTC&rsquo;s Lebanon Education Center, said he was happy to see his credits transferring to Missouri State University without a hitch.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very smooth transition. It worked out well,&rdquo; he said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Barrett said it&rsquo;s very important that students who plan to transfer come to the fair to check what the various universities expect.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&ldquo;So many schools have their own set of deadlines. You don&rsquo;t want to miss a deadline for admissions or for a scholarship opportunity,&rdquo; Barrett said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Talking with the local representatives at the transfer fair will help a student prepare for their next big educational step.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&ldquo;You can talk to the colleges about what elective choices there are. It will help you be prepared as you can be to meet the requirements of the next school you attend,&rdquo; Barrett said.</span></p>

                    <p>When Todd Ray&rsquo;s family business in Osage Beach went under in 2011 as a result of the bad economy, Ray set off to find another line of work that had that same family atmosphere.</p>
<p>With the help of OTC&rsquo;s Transport Training Institute, Ray found what he was looking for as a driver for TSCI/Transland Inc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really couldn&rsquo;t find a job at first but I saw a lot of trucks on the road. I had a pilot&rsquo;s license but not a trucker&rsquo;s license. After doing a lot of research into trucking schools, I found OTC and went to school,&rdquo; said Ray.</p>
<p>It was while Ray was in the middle of training at OTC that representatives from TCSI/Transland found Ray and hired him even before he graduated from the program.</p>
<p>Mike Walker, president of TCSI/Transland Inc., was one of the first TTI advisory board members when the institute started in April 2007. The company donated a tractor and two trailers for students to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Walker has hired several TTI graduates and appreciates the College&rsquo;s efforts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t bring new people into the industry, we aren&rsquo;t going to survive. The institute trains and mentors them to be professional,&rdquo; he said shortly after the program began at OTC.</p>
<p>Ray said the OTC program did a lot to help him secure the necessary license to be an over-the-road, long-haul driver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It got me to pass the test on the first try. It taught me everything. Quite a bit of it I use on the road,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The work isn&rsquo;t easy. In addition to driving, he has to plan his trip, check roads and make sure he follows the first rule of hauling: don&rsquo;t hit anything with the truck. So far, he hasn&rsquo;t dinged anything.</p>
<p>Ray has a wife and two boys and his job requires him to be on the road two weeks at a time and back for a day and a half.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boys want to come on a ride with me but I have to have 90 days solo before I can do that,&rdquo; Ray said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy with what I do now. Working for Transland is like working for a family. It&rsquo;s a nice size. It&rsquo;s what I was looking for. I enjoy it. It&rsquo;s a career for me.&rdquo;</p>

		<title>TTI students to begin using new training simulator </title>

                    <!-- @font-face {   font-family: "Arial"; }@font-face {   font-family: "Cambria"; }p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal { margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: "Times New Roman"; }a:link, span.MsoHyperlink { color: blue; text-decoration: underline; }a:visited, span.MsoHyperlinkFollowed { color: purple; text-decoration: underline; }div.Section1 { page: Section1; } -->
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Next week, students in Transport Training Institute program at Ozarks Technical Community College will sit behind the wheel of one the most sophisticated pieces of training equipment designed to make them better drivers.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The Doron 550</span><span> </span><span>driving simulator, purchased with a grant from the state&rsquo;s Training for Tomorrow program, is housed in the Center for Workforce Development and will give beginning truck driving students a chance to drive in a variety of conditions that, until now, could only be experienced in real life as it happened.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&ldquo;In the old days, you learned by doing it. They just would get in and go. With the simulator, students can be exposed to different situations and learn how to cope with them,&rdquo; said Doug Akers, </span><span>manager-workforce specialist in the OTC Transport Training Institute.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>With multiple computers operating the simulator, students can be exposed to various road and weather conditions. The simulator can put students on highways, overpasses, on and off ramps, rural road settings and city streets. They can be placed in good and bad weather conditions, day or night situations and operate various transmission shifting patterns depending on the type of truck being simulated. The road traction also can be altered.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Students will receive three or four lessons on the simulator over the course of the five-week training program.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&ldquo;Simulation training devices are one innovative way the OTC Center for Workforce Development is investing in order to better serve the regional transportation industry and those occupational skill sets directly needed,&rdquo; said Dawn Busick, executive director of the Center for Workforce Development.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&ldquo;This simulated training allows us to expose students to a variety of adverse driving conditions that will result in safer drivers on the open road.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Busick said the simulator would save the college money in training by decreasing wear and tear to the college&rsquo;s current vehicle fleet located at the TTI center in Ozark.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Eventually, the institute will acquire hardware and software that will allow the device to simulate police cars and other emergency vehicles.</span><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&ldquo;TTI will become a hub of progressive training that companies in southwest Missouri can partner with in development of their transportation workforce. </span><span>We have high aims. This is just the beginning,&rdquo; Akers said.</span></p>

		<title>Two new facilities on verge of opening</title>

                    <P>OTC will open two new facilities next month&nbsp;-&nbsp;the OTC Table Rock Campus and the OTC Waynesville Center.</P>
<P>It will mark the start of new educational opportunities in those two regions and bring to a close a challenging couple of years for two OTC administrators&nbsp;-&nbsp;Vice Chancellor for Administrative Services Rob Rector and college Architect Harlan Hill.</P>
<P>For more than two years, the pair has spent countless hours on the simultaneous construction work, the most aggressive pair of projects since OTC built the Springfield campus.</P>
<P>In addition to the two major projects, the College has also been working on major in-fill work at the OTC Lebanon Center, which will also be finished this summer.</P>
<P>Between them, Rector and Hill have driven tens of thousands of miles from Springfield to Hollister and Waynesville twice a week. Rector has been heading up the projects for nearly three years and Hill has been on board for 18 months.</P>
<P>"It has been quite the challenge, but fortunately the professionalism of the contractor and design team for each project has kept my job manageable," Hill said.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The Table Rock Campus, located at 10698 Historic Highway 165 in Hollister, is a $12 million project that includes a four-floor state-of-the-art building with classrooms, laboratories, student services facilities and offices.</P>
<P>The Waynesville center has a new one-story building with 28,560 square feet. It features 11 classrooms and computer labs, two science labs, a student commons/lobby area, a quiet study space, and administrative offices.</P>
<P>Rector said when the projects are finished, it will mark the first time in the five years he's been at OTC that there hasn't been a major construction project going on.</P>
<P>Hill said it might take some time to adjust before jumping into work on the College's master plan.</P>
<P>"I have been running at&nbsp;a high level&nbsp;of attention&nbsp;and awareness for quite awhile," Hill said. "I will most likely go into a&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;neutral while the&nbsp;rpms&nbsp;are still racing until I get the green light for the next project."</P>

<p class="MsoNormal">For two brothers from Venezuela, their first stop on the road toward an American education has brought them to Ozarks Technical Community College.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Thanks to mutual friends from Bolivar, whom they met in Venezuela, Amado (left in photo) and Ronald Antonini are finishing their first year at OTC after coming to the Ozarks in 2011.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ronald, named in honor of President Reagan, was the first to come to the Ozarks. He arrived in January 2011 and stayed in Bolivar until his brother Amado came in July. The brothers now share an apartment in Springfield and attend several classes together at the OTC Springfield campus.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Since they were both homeschooled in Venezuela, they had to obtain their GED at OTC and now are in the OTC Honors program.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s cool here but it&rsquo;s hard, too. I have to write a lot and I&rsquo;m not a good writer, even in Spanish,&rdquo; said 19-year-old Ronald.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Both brothers have their eyes on earning some kind of engineering degrees. Ronald is interested in computer engineering.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;If I get a scholarship, I can go to another school after graduating from OTC,&rdquo; Ronald said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Amado, 20, said OTC is his first exposure to a public education system and he likes what he has seen.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s impressed me very much. What I like is that every time I need something, there&rsquo;s someone there to help me. I want to get the best grades I can,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The brothers share a few classes together but don&rsquo;t sit together in class.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;We rent an apartment together,&rdquo; Ronald said with a laugh.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The brothers rarely went to a city in Venezuela. In Springfield, they don&rsquo;t venture out a lot, either. They don&rsquo;t eat fast food. Almost everything they eat they cook themselves since nearly everything they ate back home was produced on their farm.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Honors program is going to a conference in Kansas City this week and for the first time, the brothers have to consider travel costs, specifically, gasoline prices.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In Venezuela, the price of gas is not even a consideration.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;Gas is cheaper than water there,&rdquo; Ronald said. &ldquo;You can fill your can for less than a half-dollar. The price here is way too much.&rdquo;</p>

                    <SPAN lang=EN>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Transitioning from the battlefield to the classroom can be a difficult journey for college-bound veterans. With 1,000 veterans attending OTC, reaching out to those with a military experience can be a challenge.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>But its just gotten better with counseling services being available for veterans and their family members starting Sept. 10 on the OTC Springfield Campus. The services will be provided by the Springfield Vet Center.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>The center will be open on Wednesday afternoons from 1-4 p.m. at the OTC Springfield Campus.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>OTC Counseling Services will introduce the center staff at an open house on Wednesday from 1-4 p.m. in the Farmer Conference Room (located in Information Commons West, room 211). </P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Veterans should contact Dennis Peters, OTC veteran services representative, at 417-447-6968 or </SPAN><A href="mailto:petersd@otc.edu"><SPAN lang=EN>petersd@otc.edu</SPAN></A></P><SPAN lang=EN>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"Coming to OTC is another step in reaching out," said Stephanie Starkey of the Vet Center who will be counseling the colleges vets.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"We will be providing the same services on campus as we do in our office in order to accommodate student vets who have trouble fitting counseling into their busy schedules."</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Peters said veterans need the services on campus.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Starkey said some returning vets have a difficult time transitioning into civilian life and attending classes.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"Some vets have a tough time in large spaces," she said. "If the classroom is full, they have trouble with being around a lot of people. If it's not full, they sit in the back to themselves. They are hyper-vigilant, looking around and seeing what's happening."</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Classroom discussions can be disturbing for vets if the discussion is unpleasant.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Starkey said her job would be to talk to those veterans who need help and can identify what troubling them. They will be independent session and in some cases, she will recommend the veteran come to the Vet Center in Kickapoo Corners for more help.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Joyce Bateman, director of counseling at OTC, said her offices the new services is a welcoming gesture to student veterans.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"We have many veterans who come to Counseling Services for support and their preference is to speak with a professional counselor who is also a vet," she said. "We can provide this for them now, right on our campus."</P>
<P></P>

                    <SPAN lang=EN>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Becky Seiler sat down in front of a large video monitor on the second floor of the Graff Building at OTC and dialed the phone to call her mother.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>But instead of the call going directly to her mom, a young man appeared on the screen wearing a headset. Becky signed a message to the man on the screen who relayed the message verbally to Beckys mom.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>It was the first time Becky had used the colleges new videophone that had been donated to the school to be used by deaf and hard of hearing students, including those enrolled in OTCs GED program.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"Basically, the phone provides a resource and support for the students at OTC who are deaf or hard of hearing," said Melissa Jones, an instructor in the GED program who works with deaf and hard of hearing students.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>The phone was donated to the school by its manufacturer, Sorenson VRS, and was installed a few weeks ago. OTC only had to provide the monitor and the Internet connection. </P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Calls made on the device either go directly to a place where there is another videophone or to a call center where an interpreter talks to the student through sign language and then verbally talks to the person the student is calling.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>The phone is for making school-related or job-related calls. It is also there for some personal or emergency calls, if necessary. </P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"The main reason we wanted to get the video phone was to make the OTC campus a deaf-friendly and deaf-accessible environment for all deaf or hard of hearing students," Jones said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"As a state-of-the-art institution, it is OTCs responsibility and pleasure to provide students, including those with disabilities, with innovative technologies to use while on campus."</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Julia Edwards, assistant dean in the schools Disability Support office, said the phone is a great addition to the school</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"The Office of Disability Support is glad to have been a part of such an important collaboration on campus. The video phone will be a great benefit for our students who are deaf," she said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>The phone is a hit with hearing-challenged students like Becky.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"I like the phone. I have one at home. I don't use it that often, but I think I will now," she said.</P></SPAN>

                    <p>By Steve Koehler</p>
<p>New technical education programs are coming this spring semester to the Waynesville education center of Ozarks Technical Community College.</p>
<p>The courses in heating refrigeration/air conditioning, graphic design and welding, will be held at the Waynesville Career Center on the campus of Waynesville High School.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are beginning to offer technical courses at the Waynesville Career Center which will enable students to gain technical training and college credits without having to travel outside their local area&rdquo;, said Layton Childress, OTC&rsquo;s Dean of Technical Education.</p>
<p>The specific classes to be offered including: Introduction to Printing, Basic Refrigeration Theory and Arc Welding.</p>
<p>Laura Hendley, director of the Waynesville Career Center, said there have been numerous requests from adult students for the technical courses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The center has had requests for the programs from people interested in taking the classes. We have established a partnership in our building with OTC to offer these courses,&rdquo; Hendley said, adding that some students are pursuing an Associate of Arts degree while others are looking for a certificate in a technical field.</p>
<p>Residents can sign up for the evening classes through OTC&rsquo;s Waynesville Center.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The general education courses are already being offered at the Waynesville Education Center. This will offer students a great opportunity to obtain a technical certificate or degree which otherwise may not exist,&rdquo; Childress said.</p>
<p>Childress added that with economic times being what they are,&nbsp; &ldquo;I believe this could be the most important period in years for individuals to develop technical skills which will translate into a more productive future for themselves and their community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reaching out to the community with the new courses and resources available at the Career Center &ldquo;allows us to serve the citizens of southwest Missouri, Pulaski County and Waynesville&rdquo;, Childress said.</p>
<p>The Career Center, which has been in existence for 40 years, and OTC have offered academic and technical classes in tandem before, Hendley hopes to continue to do so in the future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re very hopeful of expanding beyond this with additional career and technical education courses. We hope to continue to work toward maximization,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Shirley Lawler, OTC&rsquo;s Associate Vice President of Academic Affairs, agreed with Hendley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have a beautiful new technical education center that we hope to use in the evenings for automotive, welding, drafting, culinary and other courses,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>For more information about the courses or to register, call (573) 774-5061 or go online to www.otc.edu.</p>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>Enrollment at the Waynesville Center of Ozarks Technical Community Center continues to grow at a record pace.</p>
<p>There are 203 students attending classes at the center, an 81.3 percent increase over last fall&rsquo;s numbers</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;The center has become part an integral part of the community. Students have made the Waynesville Education Center a home away from home,&rdquo; said Rosalind Pride, the center&rsquo;s coordinator.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> &ldquo;We are excited to be a part of something positive in our community; the feedback has been overwhelmingly supportive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Pride said the center delivers what students need quality higher education that is accessible and affordable.</p>
<p>The center opened last fall in the Town Field Plaza, 320 Ichord, with a little more than 100 students attending. Each semester since has seen increase in enrollment. This fall&rsquo;s jump has been the most ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is an increasing demand for education and workforce training due to the dire economic situation in some of the communities.&nbsp; More people are seeing the need to further their education due to the knowledge and skills required to use the latest technologies in their jobs.&rdquo; said Dr. Sue Moore, OTC&rsquo;s dean of Extended Campuses and College Outreach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;If residents can attend college locally, limit spending on transportation, and still have the time to work and care for their families, they are more likely to seek and accomplish their educational goals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Overall, enrollment at OTC&rsquo;s two campuses and three education centers is up nearly 16 percent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As we have continued to grow as an institution, our student population has also grown, and we are working hard to meet the needs of each student,&rdquo; said Dr. Hal Higdon, president of the College.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;However, with state funding continuing to diminish, there is little we can do to alleviate our physical capacity issues, particularly at the Springfield campus.&rdquo;</p>

                    <P>WAYNESVILLE  Rosalind Pride cant wait to welcome everyone to the new OTC Waynesville Center this fall.</P>
<P>As the one and only director of the center since it opened in 2008, Pride is excited to see the center move into a more spacious building located just west of Waynesville High School along Interstate 44.</P>
<P>"There will be more classrooms, more parking spaces, quiet study areas for students, and offices for instructors to meet with students or to have a quiet place to work," she said.</P>
<P>"Having a place to call our own will be amazing. The new center will add to the students college experience. It will allow us to continue to grow and expand to serve the needs of the community."</P>
<P></P>
<P>Pride has been with OTC since she started as an adjunct instructor at the OTC Lebanon Center in 2005.</P>
<P>The spouse of a retired solider, Pride and her husband moved to Fort Leonard Wood in 1992 and lived on post for five years.</P>
<P></P>
<P>"My college career began on Fort Leonard Wood. I completed a bachelor of science in Business Administration from Columbia College and an MBA and an MA in Procurement and Acquisition from Webster University in Rolla. I am currently pursuing a doctorate in Instructional Leadership at Lindenwood University," she said.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;When Pride became director of the Waynesville Center, she became responsible for day-to-day operations of the center. She hires office staff, adjunct faculty and other support staff. </P>
<P>"The scope of my responsibilities as an education center director is too broad to define. In other words, you must be a jack of all trades," she said.</P>
<P>In the time Pride has been in charge of the center, it has experienced some of the best enrollment growth of any of the Colleges centers or campuses.</P>
<P></P>
<P>"The Waynesville community has embraced OTC above and beyond my expectations," she said.</P>
<P>Many who attend classes or work there point to Prides friendly, outgoing manner as one of the reasons for the center drawing large numbers of students.</P>
<P>"My approach to running the center is to be actively involved in what is going on at all times. My number one priority is hiring staff members that fit the culture of Waynesville," she said.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;"I try to promote a family atmosphere with a focus on student learning, student engagement, and student retention. A community college has a unique challenge because of its open enrollment policy. At Waynesville, we strongly believe that every student deserves a chance to succeed. Our motto is S.A.V.E. (Simply About Valuing Everybody)."</P>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>Additional workforce development courses and workshops, some aimed to help those looking to rejoin the workforce, will be offered this fall at Ozarks Technical Community College&rsquo;s Waynesville education center.</p>
<p>The expansion of courses and workshops comes at the request of residents in the outlying areas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because of the job displacement situation, the Missouri Career Centers have asked us for several programs in various areas,&rdquo; said Dana Patterson, director of OTC&rsquo;s Continuing Education Center.</p>
<p>In response to the requests, a basic &ldquo;new user&rdquo; series of computer classes is being offered, which provides a complete certificate program for individuals who need to learn everything from the basics of keyboarding to using various computer applications and tools including e-mail, using the Internet and even managing e-files.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The program is scheduled so that someone with limited time and limited knowledge can take the series and earn a certificate. We are even offering free textbooks to everyone signing up for the series. If an individual is not interested in the certificate, the person can still take any class individually as needed,&rdquo; Patterson said.</p>
<p>Healthcare courses will also be offered for those looking to enter the workforce quickly. The program can be completed in just 8 weeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are offering, for the first time, our Certified Nurse Assistant (CNA) training program. The program is a model from our state-approved existing program here in Springfield. Healthcare jobs are readily available and we&rsquo;ve learned from the various healthcare centers in our region that CNAs are needed,&rdquo; Patterson said.</p>
<p>The certification course is open to individuals who are already employed at facilities in Waynesville. In the future, the offerings will be expanded to include a comprehensive program for individuals seeking jobs and wishing to gain their credential to improve their chances of being hired.</p>
<p>In addition to the vocational programs, several children&rsquo;s classes are offered in Waynesville this fall. For kids ages 3-5, Explore with Dora is a 4-wk program designed to teach basic Spanish while kids create new projects each week. A Junior Hip Hop Dance class for kids is also offered &ndash;parents are encouraged to sign up with their children in this lively class. Preschool painting for ages 3-5 is also available.</p>
<p>Patterson said beginning Spanish classes continue to be requested in all communities. By offering a five-week program, individuals will have an opportunity to try the course and continue on as additional workshops are offered to build on their skills.</p>
<p>For more information, or to register for classes, call the Waynesville center at (573) 774-5061 &ndash; or the Continuing Ed. Center in Springfield at (417) 447-8888. A complete listing of courses (with dates/times/fees) can be viewed at www.otc.edu/continuinged &lt;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.otc.edu/continuinged</span>&gt; .</p>

                    <p><strong>By Steve Koehler</strong></p>
<p>Ozarks Technical Community College&rsquo;s Waynesville Education Center continues to grow in the first year of its existence in Pulaski County.</p>
<p>Figures released this week show that there are 138 enrolled in the Spring semester, up from the 124 who attended in the center&rsquo;s first fall semester.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Waynesville &ndash; St. Robert area residents have warmly welcomed the College by offering support and assistance. It is an exciting opportunity for the College to be part of the higher education community of such a progressive, diverse area of the state,&rdquo; said Sue Moore, dean of extended campuses and college outreach at OTC.</p>
<p>A breakdown of the Spring enrollment numbers show:</p>
<p>Rosalind Pride, coordinator of Waynesville center, said the success at the Waynesville center to prompt the school of offer 22 classes in the summer and next fall, there will be 61 classes offered compared to the 35 the center offered last fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are excited and amazed at the growth here in Waynesville. The community here in Waynesville has been amazingly supportive. We look forward to continually assisting the community with its education needs,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Enrollment is up at all of the College&rsquo;s education centers in Centers in Branson, Lebanon, and Waynesville, incousing by 37 percent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In these difficult economic times, it is even more important for higher education to be convenient, accessible, and affordable for all.&nbsp; The College strives to support the local economies of communities within the service region through high quality workforce, technical, and general education,&rdquo; Moore said.</p>
<p>Overall, OTC&rsquo;s spring enrollment is up 6.9 percent overall from last spring with a total of 10,588 students taking classes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe that half of the increase is based on the hard times we are in and half is due to OTC continuing to meet the needs of people in our service area,&rdquo; said Dr. Hal Higdon, president of OTC.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> &ldquo;I think it shows that when the times are tough, they know that going to a community college is the best thing they can do to improve their lives. More education and training are going to help you.&rdquo;</p>

                    <P>Dennis Peters, OTC's Veteran Student Services representative, has a bullet from the Civil War sitting on his desk that he looks at every day.</P>
<P>?"It sits right under one of my monitors so, when I type, it is in my line of sight. It helps remind me that someone, somewhere is in a position to be shot or is being shot in order to protect us and our freedoms, my son being one of them," he said.</P>
<P>"If we can honor the veterans and remind all those in attendance that our freedoms are provided, protected, and ensured by the men&nbsp;and women of the U.S. Armed Services, then that is what we should do."</P>
<P>It's that reminder that has veterans being specially recognized at this year's OTC commencement.</P>
<P>The 65 veterans graduating Thursday will be wearing special red, white and blue honor cords designating their status. There are approximately 900 veterans enrolled at OTC.</P>
<P>"Every year, not just at OTC but at every college, graduation ceremonies honor and recognize the achievements of those who graduate. None of this is possible without the men and women of the Armed Services," Peters said.</P>
<P>In addition to veterans wearing the honor cords, Jacqueline Griffin, a student from OTC Waynesville and U.S. Army veteran who spent a year in service in Afghanistan, will lead the audience and graduates in the Pledge of Allegiance.</P>
<P>Griffin volunteered to recite the pledge. She said it will be an honor.</P>
<P>"When I say it, I think about the troops who are still deployed. I'm proud to be an American. I've been to other countries and saw how different they can be. We're lucky to be in a great society," she said.</P>
<P>U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt will present the commencement address at the ceremony to be held Thursday at 6 p.m. at JQH Arena on the Missouri State University campus. In addition to all graduates and their families, the public is invited to attend the ceremony.</P>
<P>Missouri state Rep. Diane Franklin will receive the college's fourth annual Distinguished Alumni Award. Franklin, a Republican, represents parts of Camden and Laclede counties (District 155) in the Missouri House of Representatives.</P><I>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your broken lawn chair or barbecue grill could end up raising some much-needed dollars for the local chapter of the March of Dimes.</p>
<p>The third annual Community Welding Day will be held April 24 at Ozarks Technical Community College with all of the proceeds going to the Bikers for Babies fundraiser for March of Dimes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are proud to partner with OTC&rsquo;s Community Welding Day to continue advocacy and research for healthy babies. We thank OTC for hosting Welding Day to benefit the work of the March of Dimes,&rdquo; said Laurie A. Soulsby, director of the Ozarks Division of the March of Dimes.</p>
<p>There are no set charges for the repairs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;We end up receiving more that way than if we had a set charge,&rdquo; said Jim Bridwell, the welding instructor and advisor who heads up the event.</p>
<p>Last year, &nbsp;repairs raised nearly $1,000.</p>
<p>Anything that needs welding can be brought to the Welding Lab, located on the north side of the Industry Transportation and Technology Center, near the corner of Central Street and National Avenue.</p>
<p>Residents can have their broken lawn furniture, lawn mower decks, wheelbarrows, barbecue grills, tables, gates and trellises fixed. Items made of carbon steel, aluminum and stainless steel can be welded.</p>
<p>The event is part of that day&rsquo;s larger Community Day at OTC, which will take place from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. on campus.</p>
<p>Student volunteers from OTC&rsquo;s advanced welding class will make the repairs along with some program alumni, who like to pitch in on the work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;It was something I wanted to do for a long time. The students did top notch work for the people who showed up and the repairs they made last year. We didn&rsquo;t have to turn anyone away. It&rsquo;s really neat to see the look on people&rsquo;s faces when they see their items fixed. It&rsquo;s a good feeling and raises money for a good cause,&rdquo; Bridwell said.</p>
<p>For more information, call 447-8119.</p>

                    <P>When Tom Stage looks at a pile of scrap metal, he doesn't see it heading to some recycling site. He sees it taking shape as a piece of art.</P>
<P>Stage, who teaches welding at OTC, has been dabbling in metal art for many years, sharing his work with family and friends. Now, he's branching out and offering his work for sale.</P>
<P>"People seem to want to buy the stuff. I've been trying to get into an art sale like the First Friday Art Walk," he said.</P>
<P>Stage has been a professional welder for 30 years and has been teaching at OTC for more than four. He calls his form of art "Green Art" because he uses recycled material.</P>
<P>"It relaxes me. Instead of watching TV, I work on my art. I like to see what I can make out of a piece of junk or a scrap of something. Sometimes they turn out good, sometimes not so good," he said.</P>
<P>Most of Stage's pieces are small, which he likes doing the most. He loves making various flowers and roses. </P>
<P>"The 'Forever Flowers' are just one of the many flowers I do. All of the yard art, planter's, lighting, wall hangings, mini-metal sculptures and a lot of other recycled pieces are about to overcome the house and garage," he said.</P>
<P>Surprisingly, Stage admits that he can't draw a thing but "I can form objects through the vision I get in my head."</P>
<P>His students have taken notice of his work, and now some are enrolling in his class for the art aspects of what he does.</P>
<P>Melanie Mills, an artist, is in Stage's welding class and took it to apply what she learns to her art.</P>
<P>"He taught me all the basics of welding and how to fine tune stuff. I love sculpting and this class will make me a better artist," she said.</P>
<P>Stage said he likes to devote Friday classes to showing students the artistic range welding has.</P>
<P>"I want to show them that Im not just a welding instructor but someone who likes art. I'm able to show them my techniques and I think they enjoy that," he said.</P><I>
<P>Steve Koehler is coordinator of media relations for Ozarks Technical Community College.</P></I>

                    <SPAN lang=EN>
<P dir=ltr align=left>The spark inside Jason Bills to excel at his craft is matched only by the sparks that fly from the metal when he applies his welding torch to the material.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Bills, a welding student at OTC, will take his talents to the state SkillsUSA competition April 3-4 where he will try to repeat at the state's best welding student.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>SkillsUSA is a partnership of students, teachers and industry in the technical fields working together to help ensure the country has a skilled workforce by helping students excel in their fields of study. </P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Should he win state, Bills would advance to national competition in Kansas City in June, as he did last year. Only this year, he wants to do better than the 26<SUP>th</SUP> place he finished in at last year's national level.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"I plan on winning state and nationals. After what I learned last year, I think I can do better but its the best of the best," the City Utilities mechanic said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Last year at nationals, the 37-year-old Bills had issues with the gas lines he was using for the competition. It threw his timing off and he wasn't able to perform as well as he thought he could.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"It killed me mentally. Not being able to block out the problem was an issue," he said. "It was hard to come back."</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>Jim Bridwell, welding instructor at OTC, said Bills has a chance to do well at the national contest.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>If everything goes right, he has the skills to take first place, Bridwell said.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>This year, OTC will send more than 100 students to the state competition at Linn Tech..</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>"For the students, the competition is an opportunity for leadership and to win a scholarship," said Cindy Phillips, OTCs lead adviser for SkillsUSA. "Those who at state, win a scholarship good for four semesters, 15 hours a semester. Last year, we had 29 win first at state and 25 took the scholarship."</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>If Bills wins the national competition, he would be ineligible for world competition. No one over 21 can compete in the international contest.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>But first things first. Bills wants to win state and then focus on nationals. Winning a national competition is a dream for him right now.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=left></P>
<P dir=ltr align=left>It would be reaching a personal goal, he said. Ive never really thought about being a national winner.</P></SPAN>

                    <P>When Brie Jenkins was growing up wither five sisters and three brothers on a farm in Pittsburg, Mo., she spent a lot of time with her father and grandfather who ran a custom structural steel company in town.</P>
<P>It was there that Brie, a student at OTC, learned about the world of welding. </P>
<P>"I was always around that," the second-year student said. "But my dad really wouldnt let me watch him work since the light from the torch can hurt your eyes."</P>
<P>And today, that exposure to the craft when she was a child is paying off for Brie as she works toward earning degrees in welding technology along with drafting and design at OTC.</P>
<P>"When I came to OTC, I didn't know what I wanted to do, but I knew I wanted to do something with my hands," she said.</P>
<P>So, she remembered her days spent with the father and grandfather and enrolled in the welding program.</P>
<P>In a program dominated by male students, Brie's instructors say she is a natural at welding and learned the techniques quickly.</P>
<P>She said she took the classes in order to find work to pay for school.</P>
<P>"I knew it would get me a job pretty quick. I like drawing things like buildings," she said. </P>
<P>Her work was so good that she was hired part-time in May 2012 by Paul Mueller Company as a machine shop welder. </P>
<P>Recently, Brie wowed a lot of experienced welders by finishing second in the American Welding Societys Oktoberfest held in Springfield. Her showing was the subject of an entire page in the Mueller weekly employee newsletter.</P>
<P>She was urged to take part in the contest by her OTC classmates who knew she was good enough to hold her own against the others.</P>
<P>Brie specializes in stainless steel TIG welding, which is almost like soldering.</P>
<P>""ts more details and more like artwork," she said.</P>
<P>While she is graduating with two degrees, Brie continues to have a love for the farm and horses, which she likes to train.</P>
<P>"I know I'll have the degrees, but I want to own my own land and cattle," she said.</P><I>
<P> </P></I>

                    <p>The work of Wes Wilson, the father of the psychedelic rock music posters, will be featured April 2 at the Ozarks Technical Community College&rsquo;s Fine Arts Department at the Gillioz Theater.</p>
<p>Wilson, whose iconic poster art was the calling card for a generation of rock music fans, will talk about his work at a lecture scheduled for Friday, April 2, 5 p.m. in Lincoln Hall Room 211 on OTC&rsquo;s Springfield Campus.</p>
<p>After the talk, Wilson will be honored at a reception during the First Friday Artwalk from 6-10 p.m. on the third floor of the Gillioz Theater, where about two dozen of his posters will be on display through April 21.</p>
<p>All the events are free and open to the public. Wilson also designed a one-of-a-kind poster for OTC advertising his exhibit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t shown anything since 2005 but I&rsquo;m still doing some freelance stuff,&rdquo; said Wilson, who lives on his farm near Aurora with his wife, Eva, of 35 years. He has six children and 10 grandchildren.</p>
<p>An anonymous local collector is donating part of his Wilson poster collection for the exhibit.</p>
<p>Kathlene Allie, OTC&rsquo;s Fine Arts Gallery Manager and art instructor, said it took about a year to arrange to have Wilson&rsquo;s work put on display.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will have 25 of his most famous posters on display and several newer watercolor pieces,&rdquo; Allie said, who added that young artists are enjoying Wilson&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems like the younger generation is into graffiti art and stenciling. There has been a resurgence among them into the medium Wilson made famous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wilson has been creating posters since 1965 and is credited with originating what is known as the psychedelic poster. Today, Wes Wilson creates paintings, but still occasionally does new posters or new art of interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will be really excited to hear the stories behind the images that are so well-known and the whole genre of fine art that he really started,&rdquo; Allie said.</p>
<p>For more information about the April 2 event or the month-long exhibit, call 447-8977.</p>

                    <!-- @font-face {   font-family: "Times"; }@font-face {   font-family: "Cambria"; }@font-face {   font-family: "Tahoma"; }p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal { margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria; }a:link, span.MsoHyperlink { color: blue; text-decoration: underline; }a:visited, span.MsoHyperlinkFollowed { color: purple; text-decoration: underline; }p { margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; font-size: 10pt; font-family: Times; }div.Section1 { page: Section1; } -->
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span>OTC&rsquo;s Center for Workforce Development will soon begin offering OSHA-approved confined space training courses at no cost to local businesses.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span>The classes, which are expected to begin in February, will be provided through a Susan Harwood Training Grant from the federal agency.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span>We have been wanting to expand our job training programs to&nbsp;better fit industry needs here in the region.&nbsp; This new&nbsp;expanded OSHA training program&nbsp;will ensure our workforce is not only a skilled workforce but one with safety-first skill sets,&rdquo; said Dawn Busick, executive director of the Center for Workforce Development.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Reggie Hoskins, CWD&rsquo;s workforce specialist business manager, said working in confined spaces is a high-risk job and it&rsquo;s crucial that all employees involved in a confined space entry understand the potential hazards and strictly adhere to the work practices and entry procedures.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span>Confined spaces include underground vaults, tanks, storage bins, manholes, pits, silos, process vessels, and pipelines.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span>The training is required annually by OSHA for persons supervising confined space entry, employees entering and working within a confined space, and those persons tasked with assisting with the entry, but not actually entering themselves.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span>Hoskins said the training could be done at the Center for Workforce Development, 614 N. Washington, or at a company site where classes could be scheduled according to the availability of employees.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span>An enclosed confined-space trainer is being built at the center to teach how to enter a storage vessel from above and the side. A hoist will also be installed to teach rescue awareness with the use of a 165-pound dummy.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span>There are three modules to the training and company employees can take any or all of the modules as long as the prerequisites have been met. The three modules take a day to complete.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span>Even when the grant money runs out, CWD will continue to offer the training, Hoskins said.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span>&ldquo;We are very excited to begin offering the training and hope that many local companies will take advantage of this offer,&rdquo; Hoskins said.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span>For more information or to enroll, contact Hoskins at </span><a href="mailto:Hoskinsr@otc.edu"><span>Hoskinsr@otc.edu</span></a><span> or 447-8898 or Eric Lansdown at </span><a href="mailto:lansdowe@otc.edu"><span>lansdowe@otc.edu</span></a><span> or 447-8918.</span></p>

                    <p>Who says physical education classes are a thing of the past? Not at Ozarks Technical Community College.</p>
<p>The 25 students in the Physical Therapist Assistant program have been taking part in a number of P.E. classes including yoga, tai chi and dodge ball.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Teaching students yoga helps them use and learn techniques that they will use when they work with future patients,&rdquo; said Steve Bishop, dean of Allied Health, who leads the yoga class.</p>
<p>Students are evaluated at the beginning and the end of the 16-week semester to chart their improvement through the yoga and other fitness classes.</p>
<p>Becky McKnight, director of the PTA program, said the fitness aspect of the program began several years ago but this is the first year the classes have been held at Richwood Valley, with the recently completed storm shelter offering plenty of space for the class.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wanted to make sure that fitness component was a significant focus in the program We want the students to not only be able to teach others about healthy choices but we want them to model healthy behaviors,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Yoga was chosen, McKnight said, because it helps students learn about where the different muscles are located, the basic principles of stretching and the benefits of yoga as an exercise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students said they like the chance to stay in shape and know they will eventually use what they learn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since we&rsquo;re going to promote health and wellness to our clients, they want us to be healthy and well, also,&rdquo; said Dave Hagar, a PTA student.</p>
<p>Andie Smith, another student, admitted there were a few shaky arms and legs during the first couple of yoga sessions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But as professionals in the healthcare field, we are going to need to promote healthcare. Therefore, we need to be healthy and fit ourselves,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>McKnight said students welcome the opportunity to work out as part of the program.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of them are already fitness-mined so they appreciate being able to do that as part of the program instead of having to find extra time outside of class,&rdquo; she said.</p>

                    <p>Students hammer nails and saw wood, but they are not only gaining construction skills. They are also learning about responsibility and self-control.</p>
<p>The students are part of a special class, which began in 2001 and is offered by OTC&rsquo;s Community Enrichment Center and the Missouri Division of Youth Services, which enables troubled youth to earn high-school credit and learn about a career in construction.</p>
<p>This semester, about a dozen students from southwest Missouri were sent to the program through the state&rsquo;s judicial system and have been working on a house owned by the city of Springfield near the corner of Grant Avenue and Mount Vernon Street.</p>
<p>The project calls for students to install a new railing system for the front porch, a system the students designed and produced in the classroom at OTC.</p>
<p>Gary Breedlove, vocational counselor for the region&rsquo;s youth services division, said the program has been involved in a number of projects for Ozark Greenways, the cities of Battlefield and Ozark and the Springfield Parks and Recreation Department.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are ground-up projects in that the students design the project, work out the material costs and install the project. They get to learn as much as they can about construction in the 65 hours of class time that they have,&rdquo; Breedlove said.</p>
<p>The material for the projects is funded by whoever needs the work done. The state pays the students&rsquo; tuition to OTC. Students who complete the work receive a certificate for 65 hours in the construction field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The kids can show that certificate to a prospective employer. It&rsquo;s a win-win situation,&rdquo; Breedlove said.</p>
<p>Students, who are not completely identified or shown in photographs because they are juveniles, say they have gotten a lot out of the program.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s helped me with my anger issues and calmed me down. Anger used to be a real bad issue for me,&rdquo; said Sam R.</p>
<p>Delwyn S. said the program has made him more aware of how to act.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s helped me understand and be aware of my surroundings. I know if I put my mind to something I can do it. I have a better relationship with my parents,&rdquo; he said.</p>
