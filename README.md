<h1>Python automation library for RedDot CMS 7.5</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The RedDot Content Management System provides a vastly configurable, albeit closed-source, solution for enterprise level websites. The GUI allows for limited editing on the part of the end-users, and a few utilities for automation for the administrators. However, the utilities fall short of many of the automation needs necessary to meet the complexity of the system. There is no way provided to, say, push all pages of a sub-site through the workflow, or delete said pages. There's also a large lack of analytic tools; in case you want to count something like the number of map widgets created this year, you will basically have no way to attain that knowledge. Even estimating the number of total Web pages in your project is impossible with the default tools. This framework aims to provide a means to acquire these assets, and be extended to acquire others as needed.</p>
